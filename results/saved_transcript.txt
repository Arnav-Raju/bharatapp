 So it is the sick, meaning secure and governed growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse, team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and High Allen. We're here, where are you here when it's midnight? We can talk to you. Go ahead, you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting, since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad, thanks for coming, at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So, apologies for that. I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications. I'm going to prove the signal that I'm always ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting in agenda, often as really, rather than posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be assuming that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting will read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So, keep that in mind. Let's see, B is a read-only item. Unless anybody wants to discuss it. And see, Phil has. Hi, and welcome, Alam To, to the meeting. My best Alan to step in as acting, full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any. Alan has graciously accepted this wonderful opportunity. So, welcome, Alan. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So, anti-abuse is moving product sections from set to data science. Data science is a frequently a rename of the model-ups section. So, data science will include two stages. The existing model-ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which I need to currently have one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not an idea. And we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of work that changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model-ups? No, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data-offs. That's five of it. So, any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So, really do appreciate that. Gotta give Nila a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Nila, I truly forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but I appreciate it. I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I kind of thank this role. Honestly, and I volunteer because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here, but Tiago had set up for a container security, a bot that we plea. I think it's Monday or Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all of work for you, Thomas. Sorry, we don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented, Seisman. So we had an update from Juliano. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October, through December. I think E. Group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the date's in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the end of work day. Let's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo ever, but I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self-emvaluation, which will move into work day. And the work that we do as managers will also have in the work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-emvaluation and for the manager's work. That suggests continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact difference is on. Each IMJ read only, unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, but like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with and secure a pretty light weight, where establishing a second team with a dynamic analysis. And so, issue is there, if folks want to play, that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the IMJ. And in addition to normally scheduled some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting in. And so, happy to answer any questions, folks have a button. I had a quick question, we've done the same thing in three of them, sites with me, lens and T.A. got a P.7 change. What even a cool you'll be saying, well, how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team with a dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams. No, I know that there's Tangerine and there's Navy. I'm not a Tangerine person myself. So, what do you think? Yeah, I don't know if there's another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in the best of the team. Tomato. I don't know. What's the pretty sound of that? It's so cool figure it out. What figure it out? The differentiation, I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and with a dynamic analysis. This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum. I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and the customer escalation. So, since then, this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development offset last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it. So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes. I think J. you've already looked at some changes around refinement. That was near you. But you've got to look at frames you've used and report back by the quarter. And yeah, I got a Neil, I can't remember what we needed that was for three months. Yeah, I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or a byproduct of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that. Looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically at once two to three MRs per engineer per much higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy. projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue that it's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right. Fed wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe we may be having. So we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to Fed wrap. If you have a feature category that is. Compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the Fed wrap evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship effects for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far you got in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been detected. There is of all link in another issue, a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration. And that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically. Since there you be either the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're they're different meanings. The TLD app talked to X. Nikhil, Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on the, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes. And there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and our peers, as can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale, because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. So indeed, so I'm not going to read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision, in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, she'd take about 10 to 15 minutes. Please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel is like as an action item, follow up on Thomas, you've got E. Yep. Right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, or what? It folks can remember. The reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough main painters and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Let's speak it only for Dash. We haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, the rule of six that it died. I think it is, but it's from a larger, like, is the company, like, where do we need more main painters as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking at the wrong place. If they're looking at the relate, to find out the number of main timers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the main timers. If you've set up the routine, you know, in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller than single social trades. Apparently not. It's so, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't filled it out. All of you, like, we have the API, because of the size we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the main tanner there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just get really inscribed it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that. Looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically at once two to three MRs per engineer per much higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy. projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue that it's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right. Fed wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe we may be having. So we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to Fed wrap. If you have a feature category that is. Compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the Fed wrap evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship effects for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far you got in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been detected. There is of all link in another issue, a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration. And that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically. Since there you be either the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're they're different meanings. The TLD app talked to X. Nikhil, Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on the, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes. And there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and our peers, as can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale, because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. So indeed, so I'm not going to read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision, in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, she'd take about 10 to 15 minutes. Please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel is like as an action item, follow up on Thomas, you've got E. Yep. Right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, or what? It folks can remember. The reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough main painters and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Let's speak it only for Dash. We haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, the rule of six that it died. I think it is, but it's from a larger, like, is the company, like, where do we need more main painters as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking at the wrong place. If they're looking at the relate, to find out the number of main timers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the main timers. If you've set up the routine, you know, in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller than single social trades. Apparently not. It's so, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't filled it out. All of you, like, we have the API, because of the size we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the main tanner there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just get really inscribed it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

Transcript:
 So it is the sick, meaning secure and governed growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse, team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and High Allen. We're here, where are you here when it's midnight? We can talk to you. Go ahead, you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting, since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad, thanks for coming, at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So, apologies for that. I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications. I'm going to prove the signal that I'm always ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting in agenda, often as really, rather than posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be assuming that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting will read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So, keep that in mind. Let's see, B is a read-only item. Unless anybody wants to discuss it. And see, Phil has. Hi, and welcome, Alam To, to the meeting. My best Alan to step in as acting, full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any. Alan has graciously accepted this wonderful opportunity. So, welcome, Alan. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So, anti-abuse is moving product sections from set to data science. Data science is a frequently a rename of the model-ups section. So, data science will include two stages. The existing model-ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which I need to currently have one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not an idea. And we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of work that changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model-ups? No, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data-offs. That's five of it. So, any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So, really do appreciate that. Gotta give Nila a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Nila, I truly forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but I appreciate it. I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I kind of thank this role. Honestly, and I volunteer because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here, but Tiago had set up for a container security, a bot that we plea. I think it's Monday or Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all of work for you, Thomas. Sorry, we don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented, Seisman. So we had an update from Juliano. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October, through December. I think E. Group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the date's in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the end of work day. Let's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo ever, but I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self-emvaluation, which will move into work day. And the work that we do as managers will also have in the work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-emvaluation and for the manager's work. That suggests continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact difference is on. Each IMJ read only, unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, but like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with and secure a pretty light weight, where establishing a second team with a dynamic analysis. And so, issue is there, if folks want to play, that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the IMJ. And in addition to normally scheduled some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting in. And so, happy to answer any questions, folks have a button. I had a quick question, we've done the same thing in three of them, sites with me, lens and T.A. got a P.7 change. What even a cool you'll be saying, well, how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team with a dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams. No, I know that there's Tangerine and there's Navy. I'm not a Tangerine person myself. So, what do you think? Yeah, I don't know if there's another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in the best of the team. Tomato. I don't know. What's the pretty sound of that? It's so cool figure it out. What figure it out? The differentiation, I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and with a dynamic analysis. This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum. I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and the customer escalation. So, since then, this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development offset last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it. So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes. I think J. you've already looked at some changes around refinement. That was near you. But you've got to look at frames you've used and report back by the quarter. And yeah, I got a Neil, I can't remember what we needed that was for three months. Yeah, I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or a byproduct of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that.

But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at.

I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale, because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. So indeed, so I'm not going to read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision, in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, she'd take about 10 to 15 minutes. Please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel is like as an action item, follow up on Thomas, you've got E. Yep. Right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, or what? It folks can remember. The reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough main painters and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Let's speak it only for Dash. We haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, the rule of six that it died. I think it is, but it's from a larger, like, is the company, like, where do we need more main painters as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking at the wrong place. If they're looking at the relate, to find out the number of main timers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the main timers. If you've set up the routine, you know, in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller than single social trades. Apparently not. It's so, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't filled it out. All of you, like, we have the API, because of the size we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the main tanner there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just get really inscribed it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

 So it is the sick, meaning secure and governed growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse, team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and High Allen. We're here, where are you here when it's midnight? We can talk to you. Go ahead, you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting, since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad, thanks for coming, at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So, apologies for that. I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications. I'm going to prove the signal that I'm always ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting in agenda, often as really, rather than posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be assuming that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting will read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So, keep that in mind. Let's see, B is a read-only item. Unless anybody wants to discuss it. And see, Phil has. Hi, and welcome, Alam To, to the meeting. My best Alan to step in as acting, full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any. Alan has graciously accepted this wonderful opportunity. So, welcome, Alan. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So, anti-abuse is moving product sections from set to data science. Data science is a frequently a rename of the model-ups section. So, data science will include two stages. The existing model-ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which I need to currently have one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not an idea. And we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of work that changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model-ups? No, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data-offs. That's five of it. So, any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So, really do appreciate that. Gotta give Nila a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Nila, I truly forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but I appreciate it. I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I kind of thank this role. Honestly, and I volunteer because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here, but Tiago had set up for a container security, a bot that we plea. I think it's Monday or Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all of work for you, Thomas. Sorry, we don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented, Seisman. So we had an update from Juliano. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October, through December. I think E. Group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the date's in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the end of work day. Let's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo ever, but I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self-emvaluation, which will move into work day. And the work that we do as managers will also have in the work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-emvaluation and for the manager's work. That suggests continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact difference is on. Each IMJ read only, unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, but like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with and secure a pretty light weight, where establishing a second team with a dynamic analysis. And so, issue is there, if folks want to play, that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the IMJ. And in addition to normally scheduled some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting in. And so, happy to answer any questions, folks have a button. I had a quick question, we've done the same thing in three of them, sites with me, lens and T.A. got a P.7 change. What even a cool you'll be saying, well, how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team with a dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams. No, I know that there's Tangerine and there's Navy. I'm not a Tangerine person myself. So, what do you think? Yeah, I don't know if there's another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in the best of the team. Tomato. I don't know. What's the pretty sound of that? It's so cool figure it out. What figure it out? The differentiation, I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and with a dynamic analysis. This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum. I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and the customer escalation. So, since then, this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development offset last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it. So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes. I think J. you've already looked at some changes around refinement. That was near you. But you've got to look at frames you've used and report back by the quarter. And yeah, I got a Neil, I can't remember what we needed that was for three months. Yeah, I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or a byproduct of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that. Looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically at once two to three MRs per engineer per much higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy. projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue that it's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right. Fed wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe we may be having. So we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to Fed wrap. If you have a feature category that is. Compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the Fed wrap evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship effects for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far you got in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been detected. There is of all link in another issue, a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration. And that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically. Since there you be either the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're they're different meanings. The TLD app talked to X. Nikhil, Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on the, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes. And there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and our peers, as can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal.

I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings.

Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

 So it is the sick, meaning secure and governed growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse, team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and High Allen. We're here, where are you here when it's midnight? We can talk to you. Go ahead, you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting, since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad, thanks for coming, at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So, apologies for that. I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications. I'm going to prove the signal that I'm always ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting in agenda, often as really, rather than posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be assuming that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting will read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So, keep that in mind. Let's see, B is a read-only item. Unless anybody wants to discuss it. And see, Phil has. Hi, and welcome, Alam To, to the meeting. My best Alan to step in as acting, full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any. Alan has graciously accepted this wonderful opportunity. So, welcome, Alan. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So, anti-abuse is moving product sections from set to data science. Data science is a frequently a rename of the model-ups section. So, data science will include two stages. The existing model-ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which I need to currently have one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not an idea. And we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of work that changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model-ups? No, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data-offs. That's five of it. So, any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So, really do appreciate that. Gotta give Nila a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Nila, I truly forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but I appreciate it. I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I kind of thank this role. Honestly, and I volunteer because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here, but Tiago had set up for a container security, a bot that we plea. I think it's Monday or Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all of work for you, Thomas. Sorry, we don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented, Seisman. So we had an update from Juliano. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October, through December. I think E. Group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the date's in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the end of work day. Let's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo ever, but I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self-emvaluation, which will move into work day. And the work that we do as managers will also have in the work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-emvaluation and for the manager's work. That suggests continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact difference is on. Each IMJ read only, unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, but like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with and secure a pretty light weight, where establishing a second team with a dynamic analysis. And so, issue is there, if folks want to play, that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the IMJ. And in addition to normally scheduled some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting in. And so, happy to answer any questions, folks have a button. I had a quick question, we've done the same thing in three of them, sites with me, lens and T.A. got a P.7 change. What even a cool you'll be saying, well, how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team with a dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams. No, I know that there's Tangerine and there's Navy. I'm not a Tangerine person myself. So, what do you think? Yeah, I don't know if there's another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in the best of the team. Tomato. I don't know. What's the pretty sound of that? It's so cool figure it out. What figure it out? The differentiation, I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and with a dynamic analysis. This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum. I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and the customer escalation. So, since then, this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development offset last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it. So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes. I think J. you've already looked at some changes around refinement. That was near you. But you've got to look at frames you've used and report back by the quarter. And yeah, I got a Neil, I can't remember what we needed that was for three months. Yeah, I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or a byproduct of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that. Looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically at once two to three MRs per engineer per much higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy. projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue that it's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right. Fed wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe we may be having. So we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to Fed wrap. If you have a feature category that is. Compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the Fed wrap evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship effects for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far you got in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been detected. There is of all link in another issue, a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration. And that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically. Since there you be either the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're they're different meanings. The TLD app talked to X. Nikhil, Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on the, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes. And there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and our peers, as can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale, because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. So indeed, so I'm not going to read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision, in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, she'd take about 10 to 15 minutes. Please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel is like as an action item, follow up on Thomas, you've got E. Yep. Right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, or what? It folks can remember. The reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough main painters and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Let's speak it only for Dash. We haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, the rule of six that it died. I think it is, but it's from a larger, like, is the company, like, where do we need more main painters as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking at the wrong place. If they're looking at the relate, to find out the number of main timers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the main timers. If you've set up the routine, you know, in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller than single social trades. Apparently not. It's so, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't filled it out. All of you, like, we have the API, because of the size we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the main tanner there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just get really inscribed it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes. I think J. you've already looked at some changes around refinement. That was near you. But you've got to look at frames you've used and report back by the quarter. And yeah, I got a Neil, I can't remember what we needed that was for three months. Yeah, I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or a byproduct of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that. Looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically at once two to three MRs per engineer per much higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy. projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue that it's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right. Fed wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe we may be having. So we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to Fed wrap. If you have a feature category that is. Compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the Fed wrap evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship effects for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far you got in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been detected. There is of all link in another issue, a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration. And that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically. Since there you be either the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're they're different meanings. The TLD app talked to X. Nikhil, Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on the, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes. And there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and our peers, as can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale, because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. So indeed, so I'm not going to read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision, in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, she'd take about 10 to 15 minutes. Please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel is like as an action item, follow up on Thomas, you've got E. Yep. Right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, or what? It folks can remember. The reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough main painters and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Let's speak it only for Dash. We haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, the rule of six that it died. I think it is, but it's from a larger, like, is the company, like, where do we need more main painters as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking at the wrong place. If they're looking at the relate, to find out the number of main timers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the main timers. If you've set up the routine, you know, in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller than single social trades. Apparently not. It's so, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't filled it out. All of you, like, we have the API, because of the size we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the main tanner there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just get really inscribed it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

Transcript:
 So it is the sick, meaning secure and governed growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse, team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and High Allen. We're here, where are you here when it's midnight? We can talk to you. Go ahead, you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting, since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad, thanks for coming, at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So, apologies for that. I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications. I'm going to prove the signal that I'm always ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting in agenda, often as really, rather than posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be assuming that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting will read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So, keep that in mind. Let's see, B is a read-only item. Unless anybody wants to discuss it. And see, Phil has. Hi, and welcome, Alam To, to the meeting. My best Alan to step in as acting, full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any. Alan has graciously accepted this wonderful opportunity. So, welcome, Alan. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So, anti-abuse is moving product sections from set to data science. Data science is a frequently a rename of the model-ups section. So, data science will include two stages. The existing model-ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which I need to currently have one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not an idea. And we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of work that changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model-ups? No, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data-offs. That's five of it. So, any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So, really do appreciate that. Gotta give Nila a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Nila, I truly forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but I appreciate it. I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I kind of thank this role. Honestly, and I volunteer because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here, but Tiago had set up for a container security, a bot that we plea. I think it's Monday or Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all of work for you, Thomas. Sorry, we don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented, Seisman. So we had an update from Juliano. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October, through December. I think E. Group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the date's in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the end of work day. Let's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo ever, but I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self-emvaluation, which will move into work day. And the work that we do as managers will also have in the work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-emvaluation and for the manager's work. That suggests continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact difference is on. Each IMJ read only, unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, but like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with and secure a pretty light weight, where establishing a second team with a dynamic analysis. And so, issue is there, if folks want to play, that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the IMJ. And in addition to normally scheduled some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting in. And so, happy to answer any questions, folks have a button. I had a quick question, we've done the same thing in three of them, sites with me, lens and T.A. got a P.7 change. What even a cool you'll be saying, well, how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team with a dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams. No, I know that there's Tangerine and there's Navy. I'm not a Tangerine person myself. So, what do you think? Yeah, I don't know if there's another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in the best of the team. Tomato. I don't know. What's the pretty sound of that? It's so cool figure it out. What figure it out? The differentiation, I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and with a dynamic analysis. This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum. I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and the customer escalation. So, since then, this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development offset last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it. So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes.

It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out.

So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale, because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. So indeed, so I'm not going to read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision, in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, she'd take about 10 to 15 minutes. Please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel is like as an action item, follow up on Thomas, you've got E. Yep. Right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, or what? It folks can remember. The reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough main painters and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Let's speak it only for Dash. We haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, the rule of six that it died. I think it is, but it's from a larger, like, is the company, like, where do we need more main painters as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking at the wrong place. If they're looking at the relate, to find out the number of main timers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the main timers. If you've set up the routine, you know, in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller than single social trades. Apparently not. It's so, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't filled it out. All of you, like, we have the API, because of the size we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the main tanner there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just get really inscribed it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

 So it is the sick, meaning secure and governed growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse, team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and High Allen. We're here, where are you here when it's midnight? We can talk to you. Go ahead, you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting, since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad, thanks for coming, at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So, apologies for that. I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications. I'm going to prove the signal that I'm always ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting in agenda, often as really, rather than posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be assuming that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting will read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So, keep that in mind. Let's see, B is a read-only item. Unless anybody wants to discuss it. And see, Phil has. Hi, and welcome, Alam To, to the meeting. My best Alan to step in as acting, full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any. Alan has graciously accepted this wonderful opportunity. So, welcome, Alan. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So, anti-abuse is moving product sections from set to data science. Data science is a frequently a rename of the model-ups section. So, data science will include two stages. The existing model-ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which I need to currently have one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not an idea. And we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of work that changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model-ups? No, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data-offs. That's five of it. So, any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So, really do appreciate that. Gotta give Nila a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Nila, I truly forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but I appreciate it. I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I kind of thank this role. Honestly, and I volunteer because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here, but Tiago had set up for a container security, a bot that we plea. I think it's Monday or Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all of work for you, Thomas. Sorry, we don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented, Seisman. So we had an update from Juliano. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October, through December. I think E. Group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the date's in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the end of work day. Let's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo ever, but I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self-emvaluation, which will move into work day. And the work that we do as managers will also have in the work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-emvaluation and for the manager's work. That suggests continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact difference is on. Each IMJ read only, unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, but like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with and secure a pretty light weight, where establishing a second team with a dynamic analysis. And so, issue is there, if folks want to play, that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the IMJ. And in addition to normally scheduled some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting in. And so, happy to answer any questions, folks have a button. I had a quick question, we've done the same thing in three of them, sites with me, lens and T.A. got a P.7 change. What even a cool you'll be saying, well, how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team with a dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams. No, I know that there's Tangerine and there's Navy. I'm not a Tangerine person myself. So, what do you think? Yeah, I don't know if there's another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in the best of the team. Tomato. I don't know. What's the pretty sound of that? It's so cool figure it out. What figure it out? The differentiation, I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and with a dynamic analysis. This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum. I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and the customer escalation. So, since then, this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development offset last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it. So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes. I think J. you've already looked at some changes around refinement. That was near you. But you've got to look at frames you've used and report back by the quarter. And yeah, I got a Neil, I can't remember what we needed that was for three months. Yeah, I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or a byproduct of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that. Looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically at once two to three MRs per engineer per much higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy. projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue that it's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right. Fed wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe we may be having. So we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to Fed wrap. If you have a feature category that is. Compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the Fed wrap evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship effects for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far you got in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been detected. There is of all link in another issue, a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration. And that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically. Since there you be either the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're they're different meanings. The TLD app talked to X. Nikhil, Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on the, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes. And there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and our peers, as can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting.

I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings.

It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

 So it is the sick, meaning secure and governed growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse, team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and High Allen. We're here, where are you here when it's midnight? We can talk to you. Go ahead, you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting, since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad, thanks for coming, at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So, apologies for that. I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications. I'm going to prove the signal that I'm always ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting in agenda, often as really, rather than posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be assuming that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting will read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So, keep that in mind. Let's see, B is a read-only item. Unless anybody wants to discuss it. And see, Phil has. Hi, and welcome, Alam To, to the meeting. My best Alan to step in as acting, full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any. Alan has graciously accepted this wonderful opportunity. So, welcome, Alan. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So, anti-abuse is moving product sections from set to data science. Data science is a frequently a rename of the model-ups section. So, data science will include two stages. The existing model-ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which I need to currently have one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not an idea. And we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of work that changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model-ups? No, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data-offs. That's five of it. So, any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So, really do appreciate that. Gotta give Nila a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Nila, I truly forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but I appreciate it. I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I kind of thank this role. Honestly, and I volunteer because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here, but Tiago had set up for a container security, a bot that we plea. I think it's Monday or Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all of work for you, Thomas. Sorry, we don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented, Seisman. So we had an update from Juliano. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October, through December. I think E. Group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the date's in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the end of work day. Let's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo ever, but I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self-emvaluation, which will move into work day. And the work that we do as managers will also have in the work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-emvaluation and for the manager's work. That suggests continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact difference is on. Each IMJ read only, unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, but like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with and secure a pretty light weight, where establishing a second team with a dynamic analysis. And so, issue is there, if folks want to play, that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the IMJ. And in addition to normally scheduled some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting in. And so, happy to answer any questions, folks have a button. I had a quick question, we've done the same thing in three of them, sites with me, lens and T.A. got a P.7 change. What even a cool you'll be saying, well, how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team with a dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams. No, I know that there's Tangerine and there's Navy. I'm not a Tangerine person myself. So, what do you think? Yeah, I don't know if there's another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in the best of the team. Tomato. I don't know. What's the pretty sound of that? It's so cool figure it out. What figure it out? The differentiation, I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and with a dynamic analysis. This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum. I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and the customer escalation. So, since then, this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development offset last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it. So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes. I think J. you've already looked at some changes around refinement. That was near you. But you've got to look at frames you've used and report back by the quarter. And yeah, I got a Neil, I can't remember what we needed that was for three months. Yeah, I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or a byproduct of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that. Looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically at once two to three MRs per engineer per much higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy. projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue that it's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right. Fed wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe we may be having. So we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to Fed wrap. If you have a feature category that is. Compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the Fed wrap evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship effects for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far you got in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been detected. There is of all link in another issue, a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration. And that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically. Since there you be either the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're they're different meanings. The TLD app talked to X. Nikhil, Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on the, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes. And there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and our peers, as can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale, because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. So indeed, so I'm not going to read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision, in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, she'd take about 10 to 15 minutes. Please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel is like as an action item, follow up on Thomas, you've got E. Yep. Right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, or what? It folks can remember. The reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough main painters and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Let's speak it only for Dash. We haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, the rule of six that it died. I think it is, but it's from a larger, like, is the company, like, where do we need more main painters as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking at the wrong place. If they're looking at the relate, to find out the number of main timers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the main timers. If you've set up the routine, you know, in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller than single social trades. Apparently not. It's so, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't filled it out. All of you, like, we have the API, because of the size we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the main tanner there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just get really inscribed it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum. I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and the customer escalation. So, since then, this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development offset last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it. So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes. I think J. you've already looked at some changes around refinement. That was near you. But you've got to look at frames you've used and report back by the quarter. And yeah, I got a Neil, I can't remember what we needed that was for three months. Yeah, I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or a byproduct of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that. Looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically at once two to three MRs per engineer per much higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy. projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue that it's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right. Fed wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe we may be having. So we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to Fed wrap. If you have a feature category that is. Compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the Fed wrap evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship effects for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far you got in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been detected. There is of all link in another issue, a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration. And that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically. Since there you be either the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're they're different meanings. The TLD app talked to X. Nikhil, Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on the, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes. And there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and our peers, as can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale, because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. So indeed, so I'm not going to read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision, in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, she'd take about 10 to 15 minutes. Please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel is like as an action item, follow up on Thomas, you've got E. Yep. Right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, or what? It folks can remember. The reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough main painters and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Let's speak it only for Dash. We haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, the rule of six that it died. I think it is, but it's from a larger, like, is the company, like, where do we need more main painters as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking at the wrong place. If they're looking at the relate, to find out the number of main timers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the main timers. If you've set up the routine, you know, in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller than single social trades. Apparently not. It's so, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't filled it out. All of you, like, we have the API, because of the size we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the main tanner there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just get really inscribed it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

Transcript:
 So it is the sick, meaning secure and governed growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse, team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and High Allen. We're here, where are you here when it's midnight? We can talk to you. Go ahead, you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting, since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad, thanks for coming, at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So, apologies for that. I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications. I'm going to prove the signal that I'm always ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting in agenda, often as really, rather than posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be assuming that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting will read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So, keep that in mind. Let's see, B is a read-only item. Unless anybody wants to discuss it. And see, Phil has. Hi, and welcome, Alam To, to the meeting. My best Alan to step in as acting, full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any. Alan has graciously accepted this wonderful opportunity. So, welcome, Alan. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So, anti-abuse is moving product sections from set to data science. Data science is a frequently a rename of the model-ups section. So, data science will include two stages. The existing model-ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which I need to currently have one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not an idea. And we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of work that changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model-ups? No, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data-offs. That's five of it. So, any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So, really do appreciate that. Gotta give Nila a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Nila, I truly forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but I appreciate it. I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I kind of thank this role. Honestly, and I volunteer because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here, but Tiago had set up for a container security, a bot that we plea. I think it's Monday or Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all of work for you, Thomas. Sorry, we don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented, Seisman. So we had an update from Juliano. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October, through December. I think E. Group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the date's in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the end of work day. Let's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo ever, but I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self-emvaluation, which will move into work day. And the work that we do as managers will also have in the work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-emvaluation and for the manager's work. That suggests continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact difference is on. Each IMJ read only, unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, but like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with and secure a pretty light weight, where establishing a second team with a dynamic analysis. And so, issue is there, if folks want to play, that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the IMJ. And in addition to normally scheduled some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting in. And so, happy to answer any questions, folks have a button. I had a quick question, we've done the same thing in three of them, sites with me, lens and T.A. got a P.7 change. What even a cool you'll be saying, well, how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team with a dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams. No, I know that there's Tangerine and there's Navy. I'm not a Tangerine person myself. So, what do you think? Yeah, I don't know if there's another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in the best of the team. Tomato. I don't know. What's the pretty sound of that? It's so cool figure it out. What figure it out? The differentiation, I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and with a dynamic analysis. This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum.

So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale, because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. So indeed, so I'm not going to read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision, in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, she'd take about 10 to 15 minutes. Please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel is like as an action item, follow up on Thomas, you've got E. Yep. Right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, or what? It folks can remember. The reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough main painters and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Let's speak it only for Dash. We haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, the rule of six that it died. I think it is, but it's from a larger, like, is the company, like, where do we need more main painters as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking at the wrong place. If they're looking at the relate, to find out the number of main timers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the main timers. If you've set up the routine, you know, in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller than single social trades. Apparently not. It's so, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't filled it out. All of you, like, we have the API, because of the size we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the main tanner there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just get really inscribed it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

 So it is the sick, meaning secure and governed growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse, team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and High Allen. We're here, where are you here when it's midnight? We can talk to you. Go ahead, you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting, since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad, thanks for coming, at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So, apologies for that. I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications. I'm going to prove the signal that I'm always ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting in agenda, often as really, rather than posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be assuming that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting will read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So, keep that in mind. Let's see, B is a read-only item. Unless anybody wants to discuss it. And see, Phil has. Hi, and welcome, Alam To, to the meeting. My best Alan to step in as acting, full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any. Alan has graciously accepted this wonderful opportunity. So, welcome, Alan. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So, anti-abuse is moving product sections from set to data science. Data science is a frequently a rename of the model-ups section. So, data science will include two stages. The existing model-ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which I need to currently have one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not an idea. And we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of work that changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model-ups? No, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data-offs. That's five of it. So, any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So, really do appreciate that. Gotta give Nila a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Nila, I truly forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but I appreciate it. I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I kind of thank this role. Honestly, and I volunteer because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here, but Tiago had set up for a container security, a bot that we plea. I think it's Monday or Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all of work for you, Thomas. Sorry, we don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented, Seisman. So we had an update from Juliano. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October, through December. I think E. Group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the date's in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the end of work day. Let's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo ever, but I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self-emvaluation, which will move into work day. And the work that we do as managers will also have in the work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-emvaluation and for the manager's work. That suggests continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact difference is on. Each IMJ read only, unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, but like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with and secure a pretty light weight, where establishing a second team with a dynamic analysis. And so, issue is there, if folks want to play, that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the IMJ. And in addition to normally scheduled some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting in. And so, happy to answer any questions, folks have a button. I had a quick question, we've done the same thing in three of them, sites with me, lens and T.A. got a P.7 change. What even a cool you'll be saying, well, how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team with a dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams. No, I know that there's Tangerine and there's Navy. I'm not a Tangerine person myself. So, what do you think? Yeah, I don't know if there's another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in the best of the team. Tomato. I don't know. What's the pretty sound of that? It's so cool figure it out. What figure it out? The differentiation, I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and with a dynamic analysis. This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum. I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and the customer escalation. So, since then, this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development offset last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it. So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes. I think J. you've already looked at some changes around refinement. That was near you. But you've got to look at frames you've used and report back by the quarter. And yeah, I got a Neil, I can't remember what we needed that was for three months. Yeah, I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or a byproduct of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that. Looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically at once two to three MRs per engineer per much higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy. projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue that it's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right. Fed wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe we may be having. So we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to Fed wrap. If you have a feature category that is. Compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the Fed wrap evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship effects for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far you got in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been detected. There is of all link in another issue, a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration. And that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically. Since there you be either the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're they're different meanings. The TLD app talked to X. Nikhil, Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on the, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes. And there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and our peers, as can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale, because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. So indeed, so I'm not going to read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision, in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, she'd take about 10 to 15 minutes. Please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel is like as an action item, follow up on Thomas, you've got E. Yep. Right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, or what? It folks can remember. The reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough main painters and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Let's speak it only for Dash. We haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, the rule of six that it died. I think it is, but it's from a larger, like, is the company, like, where do we need more main painters as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking at the wrong place. If they're looking at the relate, to find out the number of main timers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the main timers. If you've set up the routine, you know, in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller than single social trades. Apparently not. It's so, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't filled it out. All of you, like, we have the API, because of the size we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the main tanner there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just get really inscribed it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

 So it is the sick, meaning secure and governed growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse, team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and High Allen. We're here, where are you here when it's midnight? We can talk to you. Go ahead, you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting, since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad, thanks for coming, at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So, apologies for that. I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications. I'm going to prove the signal that I'm always ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting in agenda, often as really, rather than posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be assuming that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting will read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So, keep that in mind. Let's see, B is a read-only item. Unless anybody wants to discuss it. And see, Phil has. Hi, and welcome, Alam To, to the meeting. My best Alan to step in as acting, full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any. Alan has graciously accepted this wonderful opportunity. So, welcome, Alan. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So, anti-abuse is moving product sections from set to data science. Data science is a frequently a rename of the model-ups section. So, data science will include two stages. The existing model-ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which I need to currently have one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not an idea. And we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of work that changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model-ups? No, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data-offs. That's five of it. So, any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So, really do appreciate that. Gotta give Nila a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Nila, I truly forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but I appreciate it. I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I kind of thank this role. Honestly, and I volunteer because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here, but Tiago had set up for a container security, a bot that we plea. I think it's Monday or Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all of work for you, Thomas. Sorry, we don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented, Seisman. So we had an update from Juliano. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October, through December. I think E. Group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the date's in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the end of work day. Let's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo ever, but I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self-emvaluation, which will move into work day. And the work that we do as managers will also have in the work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-emvaluation and for the manager's work. That suggests continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact difference is on. Each IMJ read only, unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, but like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with and secure a pretty light weight, where establishing a second team with a dynamic analysis. And so, issue is there, if folks want to play, that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the IMJ. And in addition to normally scheduled some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting in. And so, happy to answer any questions, folks have a button. I had a quick question, we've done the same thing in three of them, sites with me, lens and T.A. got a P.7 change. What even a cool you'll be saying, well, how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team with a dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams. No, I know that there's Tangerine and there's Navy. I'm not a Tangerine person myself. So, what do you think? Yeah, I don't know if there's another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in the best of the team. Tomato. I don't know. What's the pretty sound of that? It's so cool figure it out. What figure it out? The differentiation, I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and with a dynamic analysis. This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum. I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and the customer escalation. So, since then, this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development offset last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it. So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes. I think J. you've already looked at some changes around refinement. That was near you. But you've got to look at frames you've used and report back by the quarter. And yeah, I got a Neil, I can't remember what we needed that was for three months. Yeah, I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or a byproduct of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that. Looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically at once two to three MRs per engineer per much higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy. projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue that it's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right. Fed wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe we may be having. So we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to Fed wrap. If you have a feature category that is. Compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the Fed wrap evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship effects for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far you got in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been detected. There is of all link in another issue, a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration. And that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically. Since there you be either the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're they're different meanings. The TLD app talked to X. Nikhil, Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on the, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes. And there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and our peers, as can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions.

Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop.

So, any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So, really do appreciate that. Gotta give Nila a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Nila, I truly forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but I appreciate it. I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I kind of thank this role. Honestly, and I volunteer because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here, but Tiago had set up for a container security, a bot that we plea. I think it's Monday or Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all of work for you, Thomas. Sorry, we don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented, Seisman. So we had an update from Juliano. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October, through December. I think E. Group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the date's in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the end of work day. Let's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo ever, but I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self-emvaluation, which will move into work day. And the work that we do as managers will also have in the work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-emvaluation and for the manager's work. That suggests continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact difference is on. Each IMJ read only, unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, but like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with and secure a pretty light weight, where establishing a second team with a dynamic analysis. And so, issue is there, if folks want to play, that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the IMJ. And in addition to normally scheduled some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting in. And so, happy to answer any questions, folks have a button. I had a quick question, we've done the same thing in three of them, sites with me, lens and T.A. got a P.7 change. What even a cool you'll be saying, well, how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team with a dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams. No, I know that there's Tangerine and there's Navy. I'm not a Tangerine person myself. So, what do you think? Yeah, I don't know if there's another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in the best of the team. Tomato. I don't know. What's the pretty sound of that? It's so cool figure it out. What figure it out? The differentiation, I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and with a dynamic analysis. This is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping the word not pretty in new group, it is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So, the where the fracture point is happening is a little different, but the approach and the factor the same. I hope. I hope. So, I wanted to big rocks in how they're issues. Section. I don't know if it's a big rock, but kind of long-care perhaps more than what I'm saying. Did that survey? Very good. Awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go to other results and summarize and make initial recommendations. So, lost a little bit of momentum. I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and the customer escalation. So, since then, this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development offset last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it. So, in that value there, I've seen no comments. I think for anybody in this group, which means either no time for God about it. Or it doesn't have much value. And any of those things are okay. I'm just curious where the group planned it. If you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider, not to need to do so. And to consider, not to do, but to consider. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it or not just yet. It's not, my guess is perhaps, everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean, at a high level J. Neil Tiago, we've talked about changes. I think J. you've already looked at some changes around refinement. That was near you. But you've got to look at frames you've used and report back by the quarter. And yeah, I got a Neil, I can't remember what we needed that was for three months. Yeah, I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or a byproduct of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more full paperwork like random miscellaneous, not schedule, not PM necessarily. Actions, or issues, and not actually as creating some more additional work. It's just like free time work. I want to change a pace, move to something else momentarily. And these are generally smaller types of issues too. So they're quicker to knock out. Therefore, they create more MRS, which has been a cool byproduct. So I think that's helping us to see there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. Kind of check in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MR8. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. And you can do that a lot of times here and you get a higher MR8. We're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup after implementing the refinement meeting. So let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis. We're experimenting with the new section in our finding feature. It's called Looking Forward. And in there, we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement. That will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refinement within this model. So not necessarily any implementation, but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about new. Thank you. Omar, tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down under the down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team now. So this was a topic yesterday. So my I would assume that this is more like it's a bad chance to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smugg. And that is not my intent in that. Looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically at once two to three MRs per engineer per much higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy. projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue that it's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right. Fed wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe we may be having. So we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to Fed wrap. If you have a feature category that is. Compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the Fed wrap evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship effects for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For FedR and you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far you got in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been detected. There is of all link in another issue, a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration. And that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically. Since there you be either the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're they're different meanings. The TLD app talked to X. Nikhil, Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on the, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes. And there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and our peers, as can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group and they shouldn't be. So means are optional, but has this had an impact, these new pools. And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down, but just keeping eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure and gov on brokner. Here are data ops team and this net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. Mine is sec growth and data science, which is pretty worthy. It also makes it like when I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, to Santa and Marles. He's a great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on an enrichment because what we do makes other things better. We enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but neat. That's actually my intent. It's only affects my stuff, not everyone else's. But everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Obviously, the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. That's what it makes me, as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department label. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things I would sometimes put in Slack, and I'm trying to avoid a number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot of read-on, leaving in possible. So I've got C, which is not really only. I would like to add announcements of work in a version of our series in New Hires to the meeting template. PM does this. I attended the PM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We had good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, firms shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good field, just people really knowing each other well and getting well and well. So those are just two things I took away from it. His universe reads in New Hires. Oh, verbalized Chios, comment. Great idea for New Hires. Don't care much about working in a series where you can bought for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements. As they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the meal. You like the idea of adding them? Yeah, I prefer the answers. I'm sure you don't. So I mean just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I just happen to see that the day out. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that in those engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I'm using the same that we add new content into this document for that, for that we just link to the slack announcements that we're going to make. I think it's nice to verbalise them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalise it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So so judgment call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board. That then just as a coroller, like the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make it and we underself. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale, because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. So indeed, so I'm not going to read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision, in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, she'd take about 10 to 15 minutes. Please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel is like as an action item, follow up on Thomas, you've got E. Yep. Right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, or what? It folks can remember. The reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough main painters and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Let's speak it only for Dash. We haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, the rule of six that it died. I think it is, but it's from a larger, like, is the company, like, where do we need more main painters as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking at the wrong place. If they're looking at the relate, to find out the number of main timers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the main timers. If you've set up the routine, you know, in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller than single social trades. Apparently not. It's so, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't filled it out. All of you, like, we have the API, because of the size we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the main tanner there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just get really inscribed it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added it to individual team, those yellow files, and in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you did. I think if you did. That should do it. Yeah, well, it's sure. I shouldn't be using just remotely. It should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you listed my kindness, that should cover it. The follow up question would be, does that cover the seeing you plus the engineer's must be a main China? We'll quiet them if you want. How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the lead only off your comment there so you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all. That's all. But, but the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, man, it's because it's for seeing your plus. That's going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an appropriate. I was telling about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So, I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So, I, so, they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does it, when he returns to work. Cool. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.

Transcript:
 So it is the sick, meaning secure and govern growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and Hi Allen. Glad you're here. Why are you here when it's midnight? We can talk about glad you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad thanks for coming at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So apologies for that. But I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications to improve the signal that an always rate ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group adding more items to our staff meeting agenda, often as we only read them, posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be showing that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting or read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So keep that in mind. That's the B is a read only item unless anybody wants to discuss it. And C Phil has. Hi, I'm welcome. Alampton to the meeting. I've asked Alam to step in as acting full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any in. Alam has graciously accepted. This wonderful opportunity. So welcome Alam. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So anti-abuse is moving product sections from sec to data science. Data science is a thick of the arenaing of the model ups section. So data science will include two stages. The existing model ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which only currently has one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split the anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not a near-metre. And we're working for all the changes around that. There's lots of work there changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model ups? No, I think for us we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data offs. That's part of it. Yeah. So any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for. And I'm also going to be sharing the application meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So really do appreciate that. Gotta give Neil a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Neil, I totally forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but appreciate it. And you know, I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I have a thankless role. Honestly, and I have volunteered because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here. But Tiago had set up for container security a bot that weekly. I think it's Monday or like Sunday. We'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all the work for you. Thomas, sorry. We don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill, you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented assessment. So we had an update from Juliana. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it will be sometime from Medoptoe, so I bet it's brutal to see him by. I think E. Group sign office that's gifted to be Medoptoe, but before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the dates that dates on in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the work day. That's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo either. I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self evaluation, which we're moving to work day. The work that we do has managers will also happen on work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Docs, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self evaluations and for the manager work. I'd suggest continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact differences are. Each IMJ are read only. Let's anybody want to discuss them? Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late at like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out within secure pretty light weight, and that we're establishing a second team within dynamic analysis. And so issue is there, folks want to play that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the EM and in addition to normally scheduled. Some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting it. And so happy to answer any questions to folks have about that. I had a quick question. We've done the same thing in three and sites with both Neil and Tiago and each having changed. What are you going to call your new team or how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team within dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well. It's just two teams. No, I know that there's Tan Jareen and there's Navy. I'm not a Tan Jareen person myself. So what do you think you're going to have? I'm not with another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in Beth the team. Tomato. I don't know. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. The differentiation. I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and within dynamic analysis is that this is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping that we're not supporting the group. It is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So the the where the fracture point is happening is a little different but the approach and effect are the same. I hope. I'm going to big rocks and how did she's section. I know if it's a big rock but kind of blown here perhaps more known by the so did that survey where you got an awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go through other results and summarizing make initial recommendations. So the lost a little bit of momentum I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and a customer escalation. And since then this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development off site last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it so that I'd value there. But I've seen no comments I think for anybody in this group which means either no time for got about it or it doesn't. We looked at it and it doesn't have much value and any of those things are okay I'm just curious where. The group landed. And if you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider. And I think I do so. And to consider not to do but to consider. Anybody got a chance to read it yet. And think about it or not just yet it's not my guess is perhaps everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean at a high level J Neil Tiago we've talked about changes I think J you've already looked at some changes around refinement that was near you that you were going to look at for interview and report back by the end of the quarter. And Tiago in Neil I can't remember me before we ended up with for three in science. Yeah I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or by product of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more whole type of work like random miscellaneous not schedule not PM necessarily actions or issues and that actually is creating. Some more additional work like it's just like free time work I want to change a pace move to something else momentarily and these have generally smaller types of issues to use that quicker to knock out. Therefore they create more and more and so which has been a cool by product. So I think that's helping us succeed there. Yeah we're also seeing some success with we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting kind of check in make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work we're seeing a higher MR it. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated right like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it and you can do that a lot of times you're going to get a higher MR it we're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup. After implementing the refinement meeting so let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis we're experimenting with a new section in our finding feature. I'm just going to say that we're going to have a picture, just called looking forward and in there we're using that is like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement that will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover or some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refined within this milestone not necessarily any implementation. But just refinement itself. Stop talking about you thank you. I'm going to tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down underneath it in just a moment. So. This was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer teams now. So this was a topic yesterday so my I would assume that this is more if I could have changed to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smug and that is not my intent. And that looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically runs two to three MRs per engineer per month higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The the favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas. Thanks everyone so I didn't say any comment in the issue that's totally fine. People found some of it useful some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes good stuff. Thomas you've got item B. Okay, all right after this done. All right, that wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way maybe when maybe having there's so we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to fed ramp if we if you have a feature category that is dips compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the fed ramp evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on what do we need to do. For do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically that was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images that that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship a fix for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below and there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread so I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here in case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about but sort of related for Fed ramp you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised how far you going in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been identified. There is of all link in another issue a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do is for setting up container scanning and they have set up a project with a single configuration that they're asking us to use there is some debate as to. As to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically since there you be or the UBI specific images. There are there equivalent in my mind even though they're there different meanings. The TLD at talk to app sec got it. The key of the kill the images are stable counterpart of folks on no at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when when he doesn't have them so that's a. Big he's been he's been a big help that's far. So in thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway so from the development staff main meeting. I copy and paste of the notes. And there but net is the TLDR is can folks there request to me and our peers was can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duty. So last this group not that everybody's here but in the group in the should it be is all means are optional but have has this had an impact these new approvals. And it's actually I've seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. Okay. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just something's down but just keep an eye on it in case it does. Everyone please so good stuff. So. With recent changes. We've done a couple different changes with the secure and. We're going to go over and broken out from secure data ops team and this net is I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names ops dev create et cetera mine is sec growth and data science. Which is pretty wordy and also makes to that but I go into dashboards I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about one word name I've started to get feedback on it naming things is really important I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David to Santa and morals he's great person to balance such things off of. I landed on enrichment because what we do makes other things better we enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term but there's cover what we do not sure we're going to change the name which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone but me. That's actually my intent is only affects my stuff not everyone else's. But maybe everyone else is in a small way or others in a small way but we'll see. Any thoughts on this good idea bad idea. I'm not way to there. I'm looking for feedback. Yeah obviously the other examples relate to either sections or stages whereas enrichment doesn't so you'd be introducing something new here. This it makes me as well I have a subset of enrichment so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure I'm not sure we're I think you and I've spoken about this I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department level would certainly have to talk to people opposite about introducing that and work day. Okay. So a couple of things you know these kinds of things that would sometimes put in slack and I'm trying to avoid number of distinct slack messages of putting it in here. Making a lot read on women possible so I've got see that which is not really so I would like to add announcements of work anniversary's in new hires to the meeting template. TM does this I attended the PM staff meeting I was a guest speaker there this week and like the comradery that we have good camaraderie the comradery there was pretty good. You know firms shadowing me today I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well as it's a pretty good field just people really knowing each other well and getting along well. So this is just two things I took away from it is anniversary's in new hires. Oh verbalized Chagos comment. It's not here yet. Yeah, it's not here. Great idea for new hires don't care much about working anniversary's where to the bot for that. But I'd say I always think the miss the bottom announcements as they cover the whole company versus the bot just announced for our team. If no interest in that part I'm happy to exclude the meal you like the idea of adding. Yeah, I heard her shows you don't. I mean just last week I think it was Phil celebrated his third year and I congratulated him but then I missed another team member in sec. You know because there's like 20 people on that list plus it's team member updates that's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly I just happen to see that the day of so. I do like being able to celebrate together in this group maybe also thanks or praise section like thanks for doing this and great job on that. So remind ourselves to do that as engineers we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I used to do something that we add new content into the stock human for that, whether we just link to the slack announcements that we've already made. I think it's nice to verbalize them. I just lack announcements but also verbalize it I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be but please don't over don't create busy work for yourself either so so judgment call by each person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. I like it we don't celebrate enough we don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board that just as a coroller laid a thing that I haven't communicated well. I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why retrospectives new hires discretionary bonuses work anniversary's big feature releases. I mean anything that we want to announce and celebrate we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shop to the rooftops but we're shop to the heavens but but if we if we if there are big deals and we don't make and we underself. In my opinion yeah. Oh sorry and hey for Nando here so I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team and I'll send the document right now. I'll which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings and it kind of shows you can kind you can look through it I shared it to everyone on the zoom chat. But you can see that we provide updates the new team members and small little introductions and you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale because what we're seeing is. These employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done and they're getting shout outs because a lot of times. At least in our team the case is we don't really although we work with each other where we sometimes are kind of siloed busy working on different things so it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing so somewhat related to to what you were just speaking on but just that I'd share that. Thanks for an idea. Going D so I'm not going to read all this from Daniel Kracht but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department on mission and vision in particular the approach is one everybody open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions anybody interested so if you're interested in doing so. Should take about 10 to 15 minutes please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development off site that Daniel said is an action item to follow up on. Thomas you've got. Yep. Right because I cannot remember and so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer really. If folks can remember the reason I'm asking is is contained within that thread but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough maintainers and any given project and since we don't use it. We're showing up and so that's why I was that's why I'm asking. Yeah, when you say we're reviewer will that are you talking about on the individual analyzers. Yeah. Let's be you don't link for dash we haven't have a need for it because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, rule of six I did die that's what I kind of think it is but it's from a larger like if the company like where do we need more maintainers is the question is that the organization is asking. I mean, I'd suggest they're looking in the wrong place if they're looking and really to see to find out the number of maintainers that's the wrong place the engineering projects page should list all the maintainers if you set up your team yearma in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller single social choice. Apparently not. So yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on somebody's project we just haven't told it out. I'll give you like we have the API. We've got a couple of flaws we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the maintainer there because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth we need to just get through and scrub it. Sorry, Seth and reminded of this. I'm reminded of this spider man meme with the two spider men pointing at each other who's from your who's the author it's it's the same person. It's been a long day so much. So but yes, that makes sense. So say, you saying you haven't added up to individual team members, yeah, well, father's in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one we there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think I think I think that should do it. Yeah, well, it sure it shouldn't be using just to relate. They should be using that as a source of truth and I think if you've listed my kindness. That should cover. I follow up question would be does that does that cover the senior plus engineers must be a maintainer requirement or not. How must you buried the lead the what you call buried the lead. I took the read only off your comment there. So you can post it. Well, we're we're going to end with the best things of the day. That's all. But, but. But the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, maybe because it's required for senior plus. The one back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an. Yeah, I know I was just making sure we were finished with the topic of both. All right. And we're at time so I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the newest addition to their family is here and happened over the weekend. So I so they can. They can grasp this family for that and I will be. Hopefully to celebrate him. Later when he does when he when he returns to work. Google. Thanks for everybody. Have a great day.

 So it is the sick, meaning secure and govern growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and Hi Allen. Glad you're here. Why are you here when it's midnight? We can talk about glad you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad thanks for coming at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So apologies for that. But I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications to improve the signal that an always rate ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group adding more items to our staff meeting agenda, often as we only read them, posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be showing that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting or read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So keep that in mind. That's the B is a read only item unless anybody wants to discuss it. And C Phil has. Hi, I'm welcome. Alampton to the meeting. I've asked Alam to step in as acting full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any in. Alam has graciously accepted. This wonderful opportunity. So welcome Alam. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So anti-abuse is moving product sections from sec to data science. Data science is a thick of the arenaing of the model ups section. So data science will include two stages. The existing model ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which only currently has one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split the anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not a near-metre. And we're working for all the changes around that. There's lots of work there changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model ups? No, I think for us we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data offs. That's part of it. Yeah. So any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for. And I'm also going to be sharing the application meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So really do appreciate that. Gotta give Neil a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Neil, I totally forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but appreciate it. And you know, I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I have a thankless role. Honestly, and I have volunteered because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here. But Tiago had set up for container security a bot that weekly. I think it's Monday or like Sunday. We'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all the work for you. Thomas, sorry. We don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill, you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented assessment. So we had an update from Juliana. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it will be sometime from Medoptoe, so I bet it's brutal to see him by. I think E. Group sign office that's gifted to be Medoptoe, but before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the dates that dates on in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the work day. That's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo either. I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self evaluation, which we're moving to work day. The work that we do has managers will also happen on work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Docs, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self evaluations and for the manager work. I'd suggest continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact differences are. Each IMJ are read only. Let's anybody want to discuss them? Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late at like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out within secure pretty light weight, and that we're establishing a second team within dynamic analysis. And so issue is there, folks want to play that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the EM and in addition to normally scheduled. Some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting it. And so happy to answer any questions to folks have about that. I had a quick question. We've done the same thing in three and sites with both Neil and Tiago and each having changed. What are you going to call your new team or how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team within dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well. It's just two teams. No, I know that there's Tan Jareen and there's Navy. I'm not a Tan Jareen person myself. So what do you think you're going to have? I'm not with another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in Beth the team. Tomato. I don't know. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. The differentiation. I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and within dynamic analysis is that this is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping that we're not supporting the group. It is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So the the where the fracture point is happening is a little different but the approach and effect are the same. I hope. I'm going to big rocks and how did she's section. I know if it's a big rock but kind of blown here perhaps more known by the so did that survey where you got an awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go through other results and summarizing make initial recommendations. So the lost a little bit of momentum I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and a customer escalation. And since then this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development off site last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it so that I'd value there. But I've seen no comments I think for anybody in this group which means either no time for got about it or it doesn't. We looked at it and it doesn't have much value and any of those things are okay I'm just curious where. The group landed. And if you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider. And I think I do so. And to consider not to do but to consider. Anybody got a chance to read it yet. And think about it or not just yet it's not my guess is perhaps everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean at a high level J Neil Tiago we've talked about changes I think J you've already looked at some changes around refinement that was near you that you were going to look at for interview and report back by the end of the quarter. And Tiago in Neil I can't remember me before we ended up with for three in science. Yeah I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or by product of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more whole type of work like random miscellaneous not schedule not PM necessarily actions or issues and that actually is creating. Some more additional work like it's just like free time work I want to change a pace move to something else momentarily and these have generally smaller types of issues to use that quicker to knock out. Therefore they create more and more and so which has been a cool by product. So I think that's helping us succeed there. Yeah we're also seeing some success with we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting kind of check in make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work we're seeing a higher MR it. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated right like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it and you can do that a lot of times you're going to get a higher MR it we're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup. After implementing the refinement meeting so let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis we're experimenting with a new section in our finding feature. I'm just going to show you a little bit of the structure that we're looking for and we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement that will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover or some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refined within this milestone not necessarily any implementation but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about you. Thank you. I'm more. Tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down underneath it in just a moment. So. So. This was an agenda item with the EMS and I can say it now in the secure stage. Oh, this is that is the analyzer team. So this was a topic yesterday so my I would assume that this is more like it's a part of things to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smug and that is not my intent. And that looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically runs two to three MRs per engineer per month higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better, but the comparison. The the favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas thanks everyone so I didn't say any comment in the issue that's totally fine. People found some of it useful some of the analysis useful. And that's great so I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes good stuff. Thomas you've got item B. Okay, all right after this done all right that wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way maybe when we're having there's so we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to fed ramp if we if you have a feature category that is dips compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the fed ramp evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically that was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images that that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship a fix for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below and there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread so I wanted and I know I've settled a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here in case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about but but sort of related for Fed ramp you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far are you going in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been identified.

And and so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically since there you be or the UBI. Specific images. There's there are equivalent in my mind even though they're there different meanings. The TLD talk to Ipsey got it. Nakedal. Nakedal George is our stable counterpart of folks on no at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when when he doesn't have them so. That's a big he's been he's been a big help that's for. Yeah. So in thanks for bringing the set. So in the hallway so from the development staff main meeting. I copy and paste of the notes. And there but net is the TLD are is can folks request to me and our peers was can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duty so last this group not that everybody's here. But in the group in the should of the is all means are optional but have has this had an impact these new approvals. And it's actually I've seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. Okay. No loses good news on this problem unless we're missing unless it's happening and we're not noticing it where it is something's down but just keep an eye on it in case it does. Everyone please so good stuff. So. With recent changes. We've done a couple of different changes with the secure and governd broken out from secure data ops team and this net is I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names ops dev create et cetera mine is sec growth and data science. Which is pretty wordy and also makes to that but I go into dashboards I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams so I was think about one word name. I've started to get feedback on it naming things is really important I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names so I'm going to run it by David descent out of morals he's great person to balance such things off of. I've landed on enrichment because what we do makes other things better we enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term but it does cover what we do not sure we're going to change the name which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone but me. That's actually my intent is only affects my stuff not everyone else's. But maybe everyone else is in a small way or others in a small way but we'll see. Any thoughts on this good idea bad idea I'm not way to this I'm looking for feedback. Yeah obviously the other examples relate to either sections or stages whereas enrichment doesn't so you'd be introducing something new here. This affects me as well I have a subset of enrichment so it would be kind of enrichment light I'm not sure I'm not sure we're I think you and I've spoken about this I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department level would certainly have to talk to people else about introducing that and work day. Okay. So a couple of things you know these kinds of things that would sometimes put in slack and I'm trying to avoid number of distinct slack messages of putting it in here. Making a lot read on women possible so I've got see that which is not really so I would like to add announcements of work anniversary's new hires to the meeting template. PM does this I attended the PM staff meeting I was a guest speaker there this week and like the comradery we have good camaraderie the comradery there was pretty good. You know firms shadowing me today I think he said in on the PM meeting as well as it's a pretty good field just people really knowing each other well and getting well well. So this is just two things I took away from it is anniversary's new hires. Oh verbalized chagos comment. It's not here. Great idea for new hires don't care much about working in a series where it's about for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements as they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part I'm happy to exclude the meal you like the idea of adding. Yeah, I heard her shows you don't. So I mean just last week I think it was Phil celebrated his third year and I congratulated him but then I missed another team member in sec. You know because there's like 20 people in that list plus it's team member updates that's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly I just happen to see that the day of so. I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section like thanks for doing this and great job on that. So remind ourselves to do that as engineers we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I used to Jason that we add new content into this document for that, whether we just link to the slack announcements that we've already made. I think it's nice to verbalize them. So maybe link to the slack announcements but also verbalize it I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be but please don't over don't create busy work for yourself either so so judgment call by each person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it we don't celebrate enough we don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board that just as a coroller led to thing that I haven't communicated well. I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why retrospectives new hires discretionary bonuses work anniversary's big feature releases. I mean anything that we want to announce and celebrate we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shop to the rooftops but we're shop to the heavens but but if we if we if there are big deals and we don't make and we underself. Oh sorry and hey for Nando here so I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team and I'll send the document right now which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows you can kind you can look through it I shared it to everyone on the zoom chat but you can see that we provide updates the new team members and small little introductions and you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale because what we're seeing is. These employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done and they're getting shout outs because a lot of times. At least in our team the case is we don't really although we work with each other where we will be sometimes are kind of siloed busy working on different things so it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing so somewhat related to to what you were just speaking on but just that I'd share that. Thanks for an idea. Going D so I'm not going to read all this from Daniel Croft but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department on mission and vision in particular the approach is one everybody open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions anybody interested so if you're interested in doing so. Should take about 10 to 15 minutes please do it in the next week. Good stuff there so we covered also the development off site that Daniel sick as an action item follow up on Thomas you've got. Yep, right because I cannot remember and so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration archeology so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer really. If folks can remember the reason I'm asking is is contained within that thread but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough maintainers and any given project and since we don't use it we're showing up. And so that's why I was that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer will that are you talking about on the individual analyzers yeah. Let's be you don't link for dash we haven't have need for because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, rule is six I did die that's what I kind of think it is but it's from a larger like if the company like where do we need more maintainers is the question is that the organization is asking. I mean, I'd suggest they're looking in the wrong place if they're looking and relate to see to find out the number of maintainers that's the wrong place the engineering projects page should list all the maintainers if you set up your team yearma in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller single social choice. Apparently not. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart I mean I think on somebody's project we just haven't filled it out. I'll give you like we have the API. They've helped us we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone in out of the maintainer there because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth we need to just go through and scrub it. Sorry, Seth and reminded of this. I'm reminded of this spider man meme with the two spider men pointing at each other who's the author it's it's the same person. It's been a long day so much so but yes that makes sense. So Seth you saying you haven't added up to individual team members yeah, well, father's in the handbook here. Right, I believe for that one we there's just no injury for it. I mean we could. I think I think I think that should do it. Yeah, well, it sure it shouldn't be using just to relate. They should be using that as a social search and I think if you've listed my kindness. That should cover. I follow up question would be to set does that cover the senior plus engineers must be a maintainer requirement or not. I'm as you buried the lead the what you call buried the lead. I took the read only off your comment there so you can. Well, we're we're going to end with the best things of the day. That's all. But but the maintainer requirement yes it does. Oh, maybe because it's for senior plus. Going back to that is just maintaining one or more I think is the requirement for an. But, really. So I was talking about the Olivia and is. Yeah, I know I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time so I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has popped back on slack to announce that the newest edition of their. Family is here and happened over the weekend. So I so they can. Congrats to his family for that and I will be. Hoping to celebrate him. Later when he does when he when he returns to work. Oh, thanks everybody have a great day.

 So it is the sick, meaning secure and govern growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and Hi Allen. Glad you're here. Why are you here when it's midnight? We can talk about glad you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad thanks for coming at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So apologies for that. But I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications to improve the signal that an always rate ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group adding more items to our staff meeting agenda, often as we only read them, posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be showing that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting or read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So keep that in mind. That's the B is a read only item unless anybody wants to discuss it. And C Phil has. Hi, I'm welcome. Alampton to the meeting. I've asked Alam to step in as acting full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any in. Alam has graciously accepted. This wonderful opportunity. So welcome Alam. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So anti-abuse is moving product sections from sec to data science. Data science is a thick of the arenaing of the model ups section. So data science will include two stages. The existing model ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which only currently has one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split the anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not a near-metre. And we're working for all the changes around that. There's lots of work there changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model ups? No, I think for us we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data offs. That's part of it. Yeah. So any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for. And I'm also going to be sharing the application meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So really do appreciate that. Gotta give Neil a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Neil, I totally forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but appreciate it. And you know, I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I have a thankless role. Honestly, and I have volunteered because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here. But Tiago had set up for container security a bot that weekly. I think it's Monday or like Sunday. We'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all the work for you. Thomas, sorry. We don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill, you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented assessment. So we had an update from Juliana. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it will be sometime from Medoptoe, so I bet it's brutal to see him by. I think E. Group sign office that's gifted to be Medoptoe, but before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the dates that dates on in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the work day. That's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo either. I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self evaluation, which we're moving to work day. The work that we do has managers will also happen on work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Docs, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self evaluations and for the manager work. I'd suggest continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact differences are. Each IMJ are read only. Let's anybody want to discuss them? Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late at like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out within secure pretty light weight, and that we're establishing a second team within dynamic analysis. And so issue is there, folks want to play that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the EM and in addition to normally scheduled. Some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting it. And so happy to answer any questions to folks have about that. I had a quick question. We've done the same thing in three and sites with both Neil and Tiago and each having changed. What are you going to call your new team or how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team within dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well. It's just two teams. No, I know that there's Tan Jareen and there's Navy. I'm not a Tan Jareen person myself. So what do you think you're going to have? I'm not with another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in Beth the team. Tomato. I don't know. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. The differentiation. I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and within dynamic analysis is that this is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping that we're not supporting the group. It is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So the the where the fracture point is happening is a little different but the approach and effect are the same. I hope. I'm going to big rocks and how did she's section. I know if it's a big rock but kind of blown here perhaps more known by the so did that survey where you got an awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go through other results and summarizing make initial recommendations. So the lost a little bit of momentum I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and a customer escalation. And since then this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development off site last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it so that I'd value there. But I've seen no comments I think for anybody in this group which means either no time for got about it or it doesn't. We looked at it and it doesn't have much value and any of those things are okay I'm just curious where. The group landed. And if you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider. And I think I do so. And to consider not to do but to consider. Anybody got a chance to read it yet. And think about it or not just yet it's not my guess is perhaps everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean at a high level J Neil Tiago we've talked about changes I think J you've already looked at some changes around refinement that was near you that you were going to look at for interview and report back by the end of the quarter. And Tiago in Neil I can't remember me before we ended up with for three in science. Yeah I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or by product of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more whole type of work like random miscellaneous not schedule not PM necessarily actions or issues and that actually is creating. Some more additional work like it's just like free time work I want to change a pace move to something else momentarily and these have generally smaller types of issues to use that quicker to knock out. Therefore they create more and more and so which has been a cool by product. So I think that's helping us succeed there. Yeah we're also seeing some success with we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting kind of check in make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work we're seeing a higher MR it. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated right like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it and you can do that a lot of times you're going to get a higher MR it we're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup. After implementing the refinement meeting so let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis we're experimenting with a new section in our finding feature. I'm just going to say the first one we're going to say what we're seeing is a way to work out. We're going to say that we're going to work out in the next one or three miles. So we're using that as kind of a base cover or some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refined within this milestone. Not necessarily any implementation but just refine it itself. I should stop talking about you. Thank you. I'm going to tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down underneath it in just a moment. So. This was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer teams now. So this was a topic yesterday so my I would assume that this is more if I could have changed to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smug and that is not my intent. And that looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically runs two to three MRs per engineer per month higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better, but the comparison. The the favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas thanks everyone so I didn't say any comment in the issue that's totally fine people found some of it useful some of the analysis useful. And that's great so I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes good stuff Thomas you've got item be. Okay, all right after this done all right that wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way maybe when we're having there's so we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to fed ramp if we if you have a feature category that is dips compliant or certified you're probably going to be part of the fed ramp evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives and so that's led to a separate discussion on. What do we need to do. For. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically that was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images that that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship a fix for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below and there's a couple of of there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread so I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well but I wanted to bring it here in case there was any questions or commentary. directly related to what you've just talked about but but sort of related for feedback you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised how far you going in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been identified. There is of all link in another issue a separate issue that is that has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do is for setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration that they're asking us to use there is some debate as to. As to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically since there you be or the UBI specific images. There's there are equivalent in my mind even though they're there different meanings. The TLD at talk to exit got it. Nakeel, Nakeel George is our stable counterpart of folks on no at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when when he doesn't have them so that's a. Big he's been he's been a big help that's for. Yeah. So in thanks for bringing the set. So in the hallway to from the development staff meeting. I copy and paste of the notes. And there but net is the TLDR is can folks there request to me and our peers was can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duty so last this group not that everybody's here but in the group and they should be is all means are optional but have has this had an impact these new approvals. And it's actually I've seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. No news is good news on this problem unless we're missing unless it's happening and we're not noticing it where this long things down but just keep an eye on it in case it does. Everyone please so good stuff. So. With recent changes. We've done a couple different changes with the secure and governd broken out from secure and data ops team and this net is I just compared the name of the. I just compared the name of my team with my peers my peers have one word team names ops dev create et cetera mine is sec growth and data science. Which is pretty wordy and also makes to that but I go into dashboards I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams so I was thinking about one word name. I've started to get feedback on it naming things is really important at get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names so I'm going to run it by David to Santa tomorrow. He's great person to balance such things off of. I landed on enrichment because what we do makes other things better we enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term but there's cover what we do not sure we're going to change the name which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone but me. That's actually my intent is only affects my stuff not everyone else's. But maybe everyone else is in a small way or others in a small way but we'll see. Any thoughts on this good idea bad idea. I'm not way to there. I'm looking for feedback. Yeah obviously the other examples relate to either sections or stages whereas enrichment doesn't so you'd be introducing something new here. This it makes me as well I have a subset of enrichment so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure I'm not sure we're I think you and I've spoken about this I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department level would certainly have to talk to people opposite about introducing that and work day. Okay. So a couple of things you know these kinds of things that would sometimes put in slack and I'm trying to avoid number of distinct slack messages of putting it in here. Making a lot read on women possible so I've got see that which is not really so I would like to add announcements of work anniversary's in new hires to the meeting template. TM does this I attended the PM staff meeting I was a guest speaker there this week and like the comradery that we have good camaraderie the comradery there was pretty good. You know firms shadowing me today I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well as it's a pretty good field just people really knowing each other well and getting along well. So this is just two things I took away from it is anniversary's in new hires. Oh verbalized Chagos comment. It's not here yet. Yeah, it's not here. Great idea for new hires don't care much about working anniversary's where to the bot for that. But I'd say I always think the miss the bottom announcements as they cover the whole company versus the bot just announced for our team. If no interest in that part I'm happy to exclude the meal you like the idea of adding. Yeah, I heard her shows you don't. I mean just last week I think it was Phil celebrated his third year and I congratulated him but then I missed another team member in sec. You know because there's like 20 people on that list plus it's team member updates that's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly I just happen to see that the day of so. I do like being able to celebrate together in this group maybe also thanks or praise section like thanks for doing this and great job on that. So remind ourselves to do that as engineers we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I used to do something that we add new content into the stock human for that, whether we just link to the slack announcements that we've already made. I think it's nice to verbalize them. I just lack announcements but also verbalize it I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be but please don't over don't create busy work for yourself either so so judgment call by each person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. I like it we don't celebrate enough we don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board that just as a coroller laid a thing that I haven't communicated well. I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why retrospectives new hires discretionary bonuses work anniversary's big feature releases. I mean anything that we want to announce and celebrate we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shop to the rooftops but we're shop to the heavens but but if we if we if there are big deals and we don't make and we underself. In my opinion yeah. Oh sorry and hey for Nando here so I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team and I'll send the document right now. I'll which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings and it kind of shows you can kind you can look through it I shared it to everyone on the zoom chat. But you can see that we provide updates the new team members and small little introductions and you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale because what we're seeing is. These employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done and they're getting shout outs because a lot of times. At least in our team the case is we don't really although we work with each other where we sometimes are kind of siloed busy working on different things so it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing so somewhat related to to what you were just speaking on but just that I'd share that. Thanks for an idea. Going D so I'm not going to read all this from Daniel Kracht but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department on mission and vision in particular the approach is one everybody open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions anybody interested so if you're interested in doing so. Should take about 10 to 15 minutes please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development off site that Daniel said is an action item to follow up on. Thomas you've got. Yep. Right because I cannot remember and so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration or keyology so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer really. If folks can remember the reason I'm asking is is contained within that thread but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough maintainers and any given project and since we don't use it. We're showing up and so that's why I was that's why I'm asking. Yeah, when you say we're reviewer will that are you talking about on the individual analyzers. Yeah. Let's be you don't link for dash we haven't have a need for it because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, rule of six I did die that's what I kind of think it is but it's from a larger like if the company like where do we need more maintainers is the question is that the organization is asking. I mean, I'd suggest they're looking in the wrong place if they're looking and really to see to find out the number of maintainers that's the wrong place the engineering projects page should list all the maintainers if you set up your team yearma in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller single social choice. Apparently not. So yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on somebody's project we just haven't told it out. I'll give you like we have the API. We've got a couple of flaws we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone out of the maintainer there because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth we need to just get through and scrub it. Sorry, Seth and reminded of this. I'm reminded of this spider man meme with the two spider men pointing at each other who's from your who's the author it's it's the same person. It's been a long day so much. So but yes, that makes sense. So say, you saying you haven't added up to individual team members, yeah, well, father's in the handbook. Right, I believe for that one we there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think I think I think that should do it. Yeah, well, it sure it shouldn't be using just to relate. They should be using that as a source of truth and I think if you've listed my kindness. That should cover. I follow up question would be does that does that cover the senior plus engineers must be a maintainer requirement or not. How must you buried the lead the what you call buried the lead. I took the read only off your comment there. So you can post it. Well, we're we're going to end with the best things of the day. That's all. But, but. But the maintainer requirement. Yes, it does. Oh, maybe because it's required for senior plus. The one back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an. And I think it's a very nice. So we're going to work like when we're going to work. Really. I think that really is. Yeah, I know I was just making sure we were finished with the topic of both all right. And we're at time so I will move on to take that as a prompt. Yeah, Olivier has popped back on slack to announced that the newest addition to their family is here and happened over the weekend. So. So. They could grasp this family for that and. I will be. I'm hoping to celebrate him later when he does when he returns to work. Google, thanks for everybody, have a great day.

At the moment, some people are using the Google Docs, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self evaluations and for the manager work. I'd suggest continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact differences are. Each IMJ are read only. Let's anybody want to discuss them? Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late at like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out within secure pretty light weight, and that we're establishing a second team within dynamic analysis. And so issue is there, folks want to play that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the EM and in addition to normally scheduled. Some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting it. And so happy to answer any questions to folks have about that. I had a quick question. We've done the same thing in three and sites with both Neil and Tiago and each having changed. What are you going to call your new team or how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team within dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well. It's just two teams. No, I know that there's Tan Jareen and there's Navy. I'm not a Tan Jareen person myself. So what do you think you're going to have? I'm not with another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in Beth the team. Tomato. I don't know. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. The differentiation. I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and within dynamic analysis is that this is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping that we're not supporting the group. It is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So the the where the fracture point is happening is a little different but the approach and effect are the same. I hope. I'm going to big rocks and how did she's section. I know if it's a big rock but kind of blown here perhaps more known by the so did that survey where you got an awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go through other results and summarizing make initial recommendations. So the lost a little bit of momentum I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and a customer escalation. And since then this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development off site last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it so that I'd value there. But I've seen no comments I think for anybody in this group which means either no time for got about it or it doesn't. We looked at it and it doesn't have much value and any of those things are okay I'm just curious where. The group landed. And if you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider. And I think I do so. And to consider not to do but to consider. Anybody got a chance to read it yet. And think about it or not just yet it's not my guess is perhaps everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean at a high level J Neil Tiago we've talked about changes I think J you've already looked at some changes around refinement that was near you that you were going to look at for interview and report back by the end of the quarter. And Tiago in Neil I can't remember me before we ended up with for three in science. Yeah I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or by product of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more whole type of work like random miscellaneous not schedule not PM necessarily actions or issues and that actually is creating. Some more additional work like it's just like free time work I want to change a pace move to something else momentarily and these have generally smaller types of issues to use that quicker to knock out. Therefore they create more and more and so which has been a cool by product. So I think that's helping us succeed there. Yeah we're also seeing some success with we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting kind of check in make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work we're seeing a higher MR it. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated right like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it and you can do that a lot of times you're going to get a higher MR it we're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup. After implementing the refinement meeting so let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis we're experimenting with a new section in our finding feature. I'm looking forward and in there we're using that is like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement that will most likely be worked on in the next one the three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover or some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refined within this milestone not necessarily any implementation for just refinement itself. I should stop talking about them. Thank you. I'm going to tell them if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down underneath it in just a moment. So, this was an agenda item with the EMS and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer team. So, this was a topic yesterday. So, I would assume that this is more, if I could have changed to read, but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across a smug and that is not my intent. In that, looking at the MR rate within SEC compared to company wide historically runs two to three MRs per engineer per month higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the, I mean, we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy projects. And then we see within the Rails platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better, but the comparison. The favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. And I think that's how much thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comment in the issue that's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas you've got item B. Okay. All right, after this done. All right, that wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe when we're having there's so we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to fed ramp if we if you have a feature category that is dips compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the fed ramp evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on what do we need to do. For do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically that was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images that that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship a fix for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below. And there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread so I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here in case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about but sort of related for Fed ramp you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised how far you going in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been identified. There is of all link in another issue a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do is for setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration that they're asking us to use there is some debate as to. As to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And and so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically since there you be or the UBI specific images. There's there there equivalent in my mind even though they're there different meanings. The TLD at talk to exit got it. Nikhil Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of folks on no at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when when he doesn't have them so that's a. Big he's been he's been a big help. Let's for. So in thanks for bringing the set. So in the hallway to from the development staff meeting. I copy and paste of the notes. But net is the TLD are is can folks request to me and our peers was can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duty so last this group not that everybody's here but in the group and they should be is all means are optional but have has this had an impact these new rules. And I'm actually asking a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. Okay. No news is good news on this problem unless we're missing unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just slowing things down but just keep an eye on it in case it does. Everyone please so good stuff so. With recent changes. We've done a couple different changes with the secure and governd broken out from secure data ops team and this net is I just compared the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names ops dev create etc mine is sec growth and data science which is pretty worthy. It also makes you like when I go into dashboards I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams so I was thinking about one word name. I've started to get feedback on it naming things is really important at get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names so I'm going to run it by David descent out of morals he's. Great person to balance such things off of. I landed on enrichment because what we do makes other things better we enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone but me. That's actually my intent is only affects my stuff not everyone else's. But maybe everyone else is in a small way or others in a small way but we'll see. Any thoughts on this good idea bad idea. I'm not way to this I'm looking for feedback. Yeah obviously the other examples relate to either sections or stages whereas enrichment doesn't so you'd be introducing something new here. This affects me as well I have a subset of enrichment so it would be kind of enrichment light I'm not sure I'm not sure we're I think you and I've spoken about this I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new. Our name or department level would certainly have to talk to people else about introducing that and work day. Okay. So a couple of things you know these kinds of things that would sometimes put in slack and I'm trying to avoid number of distinct slack messages of putting it in here. Making a lot read on women possible so I've got see that which is not really so I would like to add announcements of work anniversary's new hires to the meeting template. PM does this I attended the PM staff meeting I was a guest speaker there this week and like the comradery we have good conradery the comradery there was pretty good. You know firms shadowing me today I think he said in on the PM meeting as well as it's a pretty good field just people really knowing each other well and getting well well. So this is just two things I took away from it is anniversary's new hires. Oh verbalized Chagos comment. It's not here. Yeah, it's not here. Great idea for new hires don't care much about working in a series where it's a bot for that. But I'd say I always can't miss the bottom announcements as they come to the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part I'm happy to exclude the meal you like the idea of adding. Yeah, I heard the answers are you don't. So I mean just last week I think it was Phil celebrated his third year and I congratulated him but then I missed another team member in sec. You know because there's like 20 people in that list plus it's team member updates that's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly I just happen to see that the day of so. I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section like thanks for doing this and great job on that. So remind ourselves to do that as engineers we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I used to Jason that we add new content into this document for that, whether we just link to the slack announcements that we've already made. I think it's nice to verbalize them. So maybe link to the slack announcements but also verbalize it I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've we add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be but please don't over don't create busy work for yourself either so so judgment call by each person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it we don't celebrate enough we don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration across the board that just as a coroller led to thing that I haven't communicated well. I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why retrospectives new hires discretionary bonuses work anniversary's big feature releases. I mean anything that we want to announce and celebrate we ought to make sure that it's. I don't want to say shop to the rooftops but we're shop to the heavens but but if we if we if there are big deals and we don't make and we underself. Oh sorry and hey for Nando here so I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team and I'll send the document right now which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows you can kind you can look through it I shared it to everyone on the zoom chat but you can see that we provide updates the new team members and small little introductions and you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale because what we're seeing is. These employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done and they're getting shout outs because a lot of times. At least in our team the case is we don't really although we work with each other where we will be sometimes are kind of siloed busy working on different things so it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing so somewhat related to to what you were just speaking on but just that I'd share that. Thanks for an idea. Going D so I'm not going to read all this from Daniel Croft but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department on mission and vision in particular the approach is one everybody open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions anybody interested so if you're interested in doing so. Should take about 10 to 15 minutes please do it in the next week. Good stuff there so we covered also the development off site that Daniel sick as an action item follow up on Thomas you've got. Yep, right because I cannot remember and so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration archeology so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer really. If folks can remember the reason I'm asking is is contained within that thread but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough maintainers and any given project and since we don't use it we're showing up. And so that's why I was that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer will that are you talking about on the individual analyzers yeah. Let's be you don't link for dash we haven't have need for because we have six engineers that's just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, rule is six I did die that's what I kind of think it is but it's from a larger like if the company like where do we need more maintainers is the question is that the organization is asking. I mean, I'd suggest they're looking in the wrong place if they're looking and relate to see to find out the number of maintainers that's the wrong place the engineering projects page should list all the maintainers if you set up your team yearma in trees correctly. I would have thought that was smaller single social choice. Apparently not. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart I mean I think on somebody's project we just haven't filled it out. I'll give you like we have the API. They've helped us we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone in out of the maintainer there because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth we need to just go through and scrub it. Sorry, Seth and reminded of this. I'm reminded of this spider man meme with the two spider men pointing at each other who's the author it's it's the same person. It's been a long day so much so but yes that makes sense. So Seth you saying you haven't added up to individual team members yeah, well, father's in the handbook here. Right, I believe for that one we there's just no injury for it. I mean we could. I think I think I think that should do it. Yeah, well, it sure it shouldn't be using just to relate. They should be using that as a social search and I think if you've listed my kindness. That should cover. I follow up question would be to set does that cover the senior plus engineers must be a maintainer requirement or not. I'm as you buried the lead the what you call buried the lead. I took the read only off your comment there so you can. Well, we're we're going to end with the best things of the day. That's all. But but the maintainer requirement yes it does. Oh, maybe because it's for senior plus. Going back to that is just maintaining one or more I think is the requirement for an. But, really. So I was talking about the Olivia and is. Yeah, I know I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time so I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has popped back on slack to announce that the newest edition of their. Family is here and happened over the weekend. So I so they can. Congrats to his family for that and I will be. Hoping to celebrate him. Later when he does when he when he returns to work. Oh, thanks everybody have a great day.

 So it is the sick, meaning secure and govern growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and Hi Allen. Glad you're here. Why are you here when it's midnight? We can talk about glad you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad thanks for coming at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So apologies for that. But I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications to improve the signal that an always rate ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group adding more items to our staff meeting agenda, often as we only read them, posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be showing that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting or read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So keep that in mind. That's the B is a read only item unless anybody wants to discuss it. And C Phil has. Hi, I'm welcome. Alampton to the meeting. I've asked Alam to step in as acting full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any in. Alam has graciously accepted. This wonderful opportunity. So welcome Alam. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So anti-abuse is moving product sections from sec to data science. Data science is a thick of the arenaing of the model ups section. So data science will include two stages. The existing model ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which only currently has one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split the anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not a near-metre. And we're working for all the changes around that. There's lots of work there changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model ups? No, I think for us we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data offs. That's part of it. Yeah. So any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for. And I'm also going to be sharing the application meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So really do appreciate that. Gotta give Neil a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Neil, I totally forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but appreciate it. And you know, I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I have a thankless role. Honestly, and I have volunteered because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here. But Tiago had set up for container security a bot that weekly. I think it's Monday or like Sunday. We'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all the work for you. Thomas, sorry. We don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill, you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented assessment. So we had an update from Juliana. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it will be sometime from Medoptoe, so I bet it's brutal to see him by. I think E. Group sign office that's gifted to be Medoptoe, but before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the dates that dates on in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the work day. That's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo either. I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self evaluation, which we're moving to work day. The work that we do has managers will also happen on work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Docs, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self evaluations and for the manager work. I'd suggest continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact differences are. Each IMJ are read only. Let's anybody want to discuss them? Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late at like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out within secure pretty light weight, and that we're establishing a second team within dynamic analysis. And so issue is there, folks want to play that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the EM and in addition to normally scheduled. Some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting it. And so happy to answer any questions to folks have about that. I had a quick question. We've done the same thing in three and sites with both Neil and Tiago and each having changed. What are you going to call your new team or how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team within dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well. It's just two teams. No, I know that there's Tan Jareen and there's Navy. I'm not a Tan Jareen person myself. So what do you think you're going to have? I'm not with another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in Beth the team. Tomato. I don't know. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. The differentiation. I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and within dynamic analysis is that this is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping that we're not supporting the group. It is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So the the where the fracture point is happening is a little different but the approach and effect are the same. I hope. I'm going to big rocks and how did she's section. I know if it's a big rock but kind of blown here perhaps more known by the so did that survey where you got an awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go through other results and summarizing make initial recommendations. So the lost a little bit of momentum I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and a customer escalation. And since then this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development off site last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it so that I'd value there. But I've seen no comments I think for anybody in this group which means either no time for got about it or it doesn't. We looked at it and it doesn't have much value and any of those things are okay I'm just curious where. The group landed. And if you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider. And I think I do so. And to consider not to do but to consider. Anybody got a chance to read it yet. And think about it or not just yet it's not my guess is perhaps everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean at a high level J Neil Tiago we've talked about changes I think J you've already looked at some changes around refinement that was near you that you were going to look at for interview and report back by the end of the quarter. And Tiago in Neil I can't remember me before we ended up with for three in science. Yeah I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or by product of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more whole type of work like random miscellaneous not schedule not PM necessarily actions or issues and that actually is creating. Some more additional work like it's just like free time work I want to change a pace move to something else momentarily and these have generally smaller types of issues to use that quicker to knock out. Therefore they create more and more and so which has been a cool by product. So I think that's helping us succeed there. Yeah we're also seeing some success with we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting kind of check in make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work we're seeing a higher MR it. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated right like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it and you can do that a lot of times you're going to get a higher MR it we're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup. After implementing the refinement meeting so let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis we're experimenting with a new section in our finding feature. I want to take advantage of the discussion about the issues we have in the jobs that the register call looking forward and in there we're using that is like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement that will most likely be worked on in the next one the three milestones so we're using that is kind of a base cover. and make sure they get refined within this milestone. Not necessarily any implementation, but just refine it itself. I should stop talking about them. Thank you, Omar. Tell them if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah, I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down underneath it in just a moment. So this was an agenda item with EEMs. I can say it now in the secure stage. This is that is the analyzer teams now. So this was a topic yesterday. So I would assume that this is more if I could have changed to read, but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across a smug and that is not my intent in that, looking at the MRA within sec compared to company wide, historically it runs two to three MRAs per engineer per month higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the, I mean, we've taken this to be true, or at least asserted it to be true, and that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy projects. Then we see within the Rails platform itself, which does have an impact. It's not to say that we cannot do better, but the comparison, the favorable comparison, at least to me and I will admit this, at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas, thanks everyone. So I didn't say any comments in the issue, that's totally fine. People found some of it useful, some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay, all right, after this done. All right, bed ramp and the can't or won't fix security issues that way, maybe when we're having this. So we've got them, the for security issues that are subject to fed ramp. If you have a feature category that is dips, compliant or certified, you're probably going to be part of the fed ramp evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it, which means dependency or container scanning specifically, has to have a remediation plan, even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on what do we need to do for, do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? That was the catalyst for this particular conversation because on container scanning, we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images. That that project has not shipped to fix for, or won't fix ship of fix for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes? For this class of findings, the TLDR is below and there's a couple of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread. So I know I've settled a lot of words and I didn't say it well, but I wanted to bring it here. In case there was any questions or commentary. What are you talking about? Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about, but sort of related. For Fedram, you're looking at any tips related security issues that have been raised. How far are you going in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been identified? There is, I'll link in another issue, a separate issue that has instructions from AppSec on what they would like us to do as far as setting up container scanning. And they have set up a project with a single configuration that they're asking us to use. There is some debate as to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the FIPS images specifically. Since there you be, or the UBI specific images. There are equivalent in my mind, even though they're different meanings. The TLD, talk to AppSec, got it. The key of the key of the images are stable counterpart of folks on no, at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when he doesn't have them. So that's a big, he's been a big help thus far. So in, thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway, so from the development staff meeting, I copy and paste of the notes in there, but net is the TLDR is can folks, they request to me and my peers was can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duties. So last, this group, not that everybody's here, but in the group in the should of D, is all means are optional. But has this had an impact, these new approvals? And I totally have seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval, but I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. Okay. No news is good news on this problem, unless it's happening and we're not noticing it, we're just slowing things down, but just keep an eye on it in case it does. Everyone, please, it's a good stuff. So with recent changes, we're going to couple different changes with the secure, and governd broken after them secure and data ops team, and this net is, I just compared to the name of my team with my peers. My peers have one word team names, ops dev, create, et cetera. Mine is, sect growth and data science, which is pretty wordy, and it also makes it like, but I go into dashboards, I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams. So I was thinking about a one word name, I've started to get feedback on it, naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm going to run it by David, DeSanto de Marles, he's a great person to bounce such things off of. I've landed on enrichment, because what we do makes other things better, we enrich them. It's kind of a very broad term, but it does cover what we do. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but me. That's actually my intent. Is it only affects my stuff, not everyone else's? But maybe everyone else is in a small way, or others in a small way, but we'll see. Any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to this, I'm looking for feedback. Yeah, I'll just see the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. This affects me as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure, I think you and I have spoken about this. I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department level. We'd certainly have to talk to people up about introducing that and work day. Okay. So a couple of things, these are kind of things that would sometimes put in Slack, but I'm trying to avoid number of distinct Slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot read-on, leaving when possible. So I've got C, which is not really, so I would like to add announcements of work in our series in New Hires to the meeting template. TM does this. I attended the TM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week, and like the comradery. We have good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, Fern's shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the TM meeting as well. It was a pretty good feel of just people really knowing each other well and getting along well. So those are just two things I took away from it. Is the anniversary's in New Hires? Oh, verbalized Chagos comment. Chagos, no here, yeah, Chagos, no here. Great idea for New Hires, don't care much about working in a series where it had the bot for that. But I'd say I always seem to miss the bottom announcements as they come with the whole company versus the bot just announcing for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the Neil, you like the idea of adding. Yeah, I agree to the answers. You don't. I mean, just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year, and I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot. Like weekly, I just happen to see that the day of. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this and great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that as engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I used to Jason that we add new content into the stock human for that, or that we just link to the slack announcements that we've already made. I think it's nice to verbalize them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalize it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They've really add the sections and people use them as they see fit, whatever that happens to be. But please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So Jason, call. Thanks person. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas in mind yet, some thoughts on this too. Yeah, I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion, team celebration across the board. And just as a correlator, the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives, new hires, discretionary bonuses, work and adversaries, big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's, I don't want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but there are big deals and we don't make it. And we undersell it. In my opinion. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now, just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat. But you can see that we provide updates, the new team members and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good. And how we can highlight that, because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale because what we're seeing is, these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're getting shoutouts, because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed, busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks for Nida. Going D. So I'm not gonna read all of this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision and mission and direction. We're brainstorming on the development department, on mission and vision and particular, the approach is going, everybody, open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, should take about 10 to 15 minutes, please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development offsite that Daniel took as an action item to follow up on. Thomas, you've got E. Yep. All right, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of this configuration archeology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer, Ruelett? If folks can remember, the reason I'm asking is, is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough maintainers and any given project. And since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say, Ruelett, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Speaking only for DAS, we haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers that's just gonna rule that the same six people. Yeah, Ruelett's six-sided dive. That's what I kind of think it is, but it's from a larger, like, if the company, like, where do we need more maintainers as to question is that the organization is asking? Yeah. I mean, I'd suggest they're looking in the wrong place. If they're looking in a roulette, to see, to find out the number of maintainers, that's the wrong place. The engineering projects page should list all the maintainers. If you set up your team, you're more in-treet correctly. I would have thought that was smaller, single social trade. Apparently not. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't told it out. All of you, like, we have the API, we've had one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone in the maintainer there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social truth, we need to just go through and scrub it. Sorry, Seth, and we're reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so I'm a little punchy. So, but yes, that makes sense. So, Seth, you saying you haven't added up to individual team name as YAML files in the Handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think, I think, that should do it. That should do it. Yeah, well, that's sure. They shouldn't be using just reliant. They should be using that as a social truth, and I think if you've listed my entire, that should cover it. I follow up, question would be, does that cover the senior plus, the engineer's must be a maintainer? Requirement or not? How am I supposed to bury the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the read-only off your comment there, so you could have noticed it. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. That's all, that's not it. But, but the maintainer requirement, yes, it does. Oh, maybe because it's for senior plus, that is going back to that, is just maintaining one or more, I think is the requirement for an approval correctly. So, I was talking about the Olivia and you. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic of both. All right. And we're at time, so I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has popped back on Slack to announce that the news edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. Yeah, so I, so they can grasp this family for that. And we'll be, hopefully, to celebrate him later when he does when he returns to work. Oh, cool. Thanks for everybody. Have a great day.

 So it is the sick, meaning secure and govern growth and data science, meaning the Plyd ML ML ops and anti abuse team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APEC and Hi Allen. Glad you're here. Why are you here when it's midnight? We can talk about glad you're here. Don't make it happen to come to this meeting since it's really late for you. So, but I'm glad thanks for coming at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So apologies for that. But I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications to improve the signal that an always rate ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This will is written for this group adding more items to our staff meeting agenda, often as we only read them, posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be showing that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting or read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So keep that in mind. That's the B is a read only item unless anybody wants to discuss it. And C Phil has. Hi, I'm welcome. Alampton to the meeting. I've asked Alam to step in as acting full-stack manager for security policies while I hire any in. Alam has graciously accepted. This wonderful opportunity. So welcome Alam. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So anti-abuse is moving product sections from sec to data science. Data science is a thick of the arenaing of the model ups section. So data science will include two stages. The existing model ups, which has three groups in it, which mom can talk more about. And the anti-abuse stage, which only currently has one group, which is called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split the anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not a near-metre. And we're working for all the changes around that. There's lots of work there changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, do you want to say anything more about data science or model ups? No, I think for us we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied MLOPS and then later data offs. That's part of it. Yeah. So any thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all my teams that I'm responsible for. And I'm also going to be sharing the application meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So really do appreciate that. Gotta give Neil a high five, too. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide your cover. And apologies Neil, I totally forgot you took half of these since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but appreciate it. And you know, I know you volunteered for it and we discussed it, but I just forgot that. I have a thankless role. Honestly, and I have volunteered because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention I'll type this in here. But Tiago had set up for container security a bot that weekly. I think it's Monday or like Sunday. We'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. And we just enabled it for three months. It's actually pretty sweet and it just does all the work for you. Thomas, sorry. We don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. E. F is read only and Bill, you've got G. Yeah, I'm talented assessment. So we had an update from Juliana. The date's haven't been confirmed yet, but it will be sometime from Medoptoe, so I bet it's brutal to see him by. I think E. Group sign office that's gifted to be Medoptoe, but before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the dates that dates on in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do at the work day. That's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo either. I don't know what questions will be asked. But there's an optional self evaluation, which we're moving to work day. The work that we do has managers will also happen on work day. At the moment, some people are using the Google Docs, which is listed on the talent assessment page for self evaluations and for the manager work. I'd suggest continuing to use those docs until we get access to work day and see what the exact differences are. Each IMJ are read only. Let's anybody want to discuss them? Thomas, get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late at like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out within secure pretty light weight, and that we're establishing a second team within dynamic analysis. And so issue is there, folks want to play that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team, acting in the EM and in addition to normally scheduled. Some duties for lack of a bit of way of putting it. And so happy to answer any questions to folks have about that. I had a quick question. We've done the same thing in three and sites with both Neil and Tiago and each having changed. What are you going to call your new team or how will you differentiate? Was not planning to differentiate it. It's just a second team within dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well. It's just two teams. No, I know that there's Tan Jareen and there's Navy. I'm not a Tan Jareen person myself. So what do you think you're going to have? I'm not with another T-colour Thomas. I started a battle in Beth the team. Tomato. I don't know. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. The differentiation. I think the difference between what's happening in threat insights and within dynamic analysis is that this is a split or long feature category. Even though we're keeping that we're not supporting the group. It is the distinction is along like who's working on specific feature categories themselves. So the the where the fracture point is happening is a little different but the approach and effect are the same. I hope. I'm going to big rocks and how did she's section. I know if it's a big rock but kind of blown here perhaps more known by the so did that survey where you got an awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. And then I took a really long time to go through other results and summarizing make initial recommendations. So the lost a little bit of momentum I got caught up in other things across functional prioritization and a customer escalation. And since then this is actually used by John Hope to lead a discussion at the development off site last week on just improving engineering velocity is one of the things you used to power it so that I'd value there. But I've seen no comments I think for anybody in this group which means either no time for got about it or it doesn't. We looked at it and it doesn't have much value and any of those things are okay I'm just curious where. The group landed. And if you haven't taken a look yet to see if there's anything you want to take away from it on things you might want to consider. And I think I do so. And to consider not to do but to consider. Anybody got a chance to read it yet. And think about it or not just yet it's not my guess is perhaps everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I mean at a high level J Neil Tiago we've talked about changes I think J you've already looked at some changes around refinement that was near you that you were going to look at for interview and report back by the end of the quarter. And Tiago in Neil I can't remember me before we ended up with for three in science. Yeah I'm hoping that MRA does kind of an artifact or by product of some other actions. The big thing we're doing is more whole type of work like random miscellaneous not schedule not PM necessarily actions or issues and that actually is creating. Some more additional work like it's just like free time work I want to change a pace move to something else momentarily and these have generally smaller types of issues to use that quicker to knock out. Therefore they create more and more and so which has been a cool by product. So I think that's helping us succeed there. Yeah we're also seeing some success with we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting kind of check in make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work we're seeing a higher MR it. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated right like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it and you can do that a lot of times you're going to get a higher MR it we're trying to be reasonable with that. I am noticing a nice pickup. After implementing the refinement meeting so let's hope for the best. I was going to say one note on refinement in second analysis we're experimenting with a new section in our finding feature. I'm just going to say a little bit more about the structure. I'm just going to say a little bit more about the structure. Just called looking forward and in there we're using that is like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement that will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover or some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refined within this milestone. Not necessarily any implementation but just refinement itself. I should stop talking about you thank you for more. Tell me if you want to verbalize your comment. Yeah I'll verbalize and then I'll say more and then I'll finish writing what I was going to put down underneath it in just a moment. So. This was an agenda item with the EM's and I can say it now in the secure stage. That is the analyzer teams now. So this was a topic yesterday so my I would assume that this is more if I could have changed to read but not digest the content. And what I was about to write and I am cautious in saying this because it almost comes across as smug and that is not my intent. And that looking at the MR rate within sec compared to company wide historically runs two to three MRs per engineer per month higher. And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. I mean, I mean we've taken this to be true or at least asserted it to be true in that it's smaller teams that are working closely together in less busy projects. And then we see within the real platform itself, which does have an impact. It's so it does not to say that we cannot do better. But the comparison. The the favorable comparison. At least to me and I will admit this at times will lessen the urgency on this particular topic. And I have to admit that bias that I have. Thanks Thomas. Thanks everyone so I didn't say any comment in the issue that's totally fine. People found some of it useful some of the analysis useful. And that's great. So I will close the issue accordingly and just link to these notes good stuff. Thomas you've got item B. Okay, all right after this done. All right, that wrap and the can't or won't fix security issues that way maybe when maybe having there's so we've got them. The for security issues that are subject to fed ramp if we if you have a feature category that is dips compliant or certified. You're probably going to be part of the fed ramp evaluation and any security issue that has a CVE associated with it which means dependency or container scanning specifically. Has to have a remediation plan even if they're false positives. And so that's led to a separate discussion on what do we need to do. For do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically that was the catalyst for this particular conversation. Because on container scanning we get a lot of findings related to Debbie and based images that that project has not shipped a fix for or won't fix ship a fix for. So there is a separate thread that is going on here about what to do and can we do deviation requests in bulk for this classes for this for this for this class of findings. The the TLDR is below and there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of options that are being brainstormed within this particular thread so I wanted and I know I've said a lot of words and I didn't say it well. But I wanted to bring it here in case there was any questions or commentary. Nothing directly related to what you've just talked about but sort of related for Fed ramp you're looking at. Any tips related security issues that have been raised how far you going in terms of ordering to find anything that hasn't already been identified. There is of all link in another issue a separate issue that is. That has instructions from app sec on what they would like us to do is for setting up container scanning and they have set up a project with a single configuration that they're asking us to use there is some debate as to. As to how that project has been configured because it uses a combination of three container scanning tools rather than one. And so they've asked us to use that as a baseline for the fifth images specifically since there you be or the UBI specific images. There are there equivalent in my mind even though they're there different meanings. The TLD at talk to app sec got it. The key of the kill the images are stable counterpart of folks on no at least in sec. And so he's been quite responsive and keen and he is also helping chase down answers when when he doesn't have them so that's a. Big he's been he's been a big help that's far. So in thanks for bringing this up Thomas. So in the hallway so from the development staff main meeting. I copy and paste of the notes. And there but net is the TLDR is can folks there request to me and our peers was can folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecting them. So this is the new approval rules on segregation of duty. So last this group not that everybody's here but in the group in the should it be is all means are optional but have has this had an impact these new approvals. And it's actually I've seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down. Okay. No news is good news on this problem unless it's happening and we're not noticing it. We're just something's down but just keep an eye on it in case it does. Everyone please so good stuff. So. With recent changes. We've done a couple different changes with the secure and. We're going to have a few more changes. So it's just a couple of different things. And we're going to have a few more changes. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So girl. So i. So I'm going to do something about the user know what I'm using and why nicht. So by the anger that means great thing was it's something called a specialized Committee. Well it doesn't mean they don't hopefully never lead things to the bitter threat. A bit of a decent podem thing is really important and good lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. intent is it only affects my stuff, not everyone else's, but maybe everyone else's in a small way or others in a small way, but we'll see any thoughts on this? Good idea, bad idea. I'm not way to there, so I'm looking for feedback. Yeah, obviously the other examples relate to either sections or stages, whereas an enrichment doesn't. So you'd be introducing something new here. This affects me as well. I have a subset of enrichment, so it would be kind of enrichment light. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think you and I've spoken about this, I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department level. We'd certainly have to talk to people, lots about introducing that and work day. Okay. So a couple of things, you know, these are kind of things that would sometimes put in slack, and I'm trying to avoid number of distinct slack messages of putting it in here, making a lot read-on-leam and possible, so I've got C, which is not really so I would like to add announcements of work in a version of series in new hires to the meeting template. TM does this. I attended the TM staff meeting. I was a guest speaker there this week and like the comradery. We have good conradery. The comradery there was pretty good. You know, Furns, shadowing me today. I think he sat in on the TM meeting as well. It was a pretty good feel of just people really knowing each other. Well, and getting along well. So this is just two things that took away from it. Is Anniversary's in new hires? Oh, verbalized Chagos comment. It's not here yet. Yeah, it's not here. Great idea for new hires. Don't care much about working in a VERS-REASBER to the bot for that. But I'd say I always think the miss the bot announcements. As they come with the whole company versus the bot just announced in for our team. If no interest in that part, I'm happy to exclude the Neil, you like the idea of adding. Yeah, I agree to the answers. You don't. I mean, just last week, I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. And I congratulated him, but then I missed another team member in sec. You know, because there's like 20 people in that list. Plus, it's team member updates. That's not a channel I look at a lot. Like weekly. I just happen to see that the day of. So I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. Maybe also thanks or praise section. Like thanks for doing this. And great job on that. To remind ourselves to do that as engineers, we tend to focus on the problems and challenges and not the celebrating the wins. I used to do something that we add new content into the stock human for that, whether we just link to the slack announcements that we're recording. I think it's nice to verbalize them. So maybe link to the slack announcements, but also verbalize it. I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. Maybe add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Whatever that happens to be, but please don't over. Don't create busy work for yourself either. So judgment call. Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and Monyets and thoughts on this too. I like it. We don't celebrate enough. We don't do enough for team cohesion, team celebration across the board. And just as a correlator, the thing that I haven't communicated well, I was hoping to add this kind of thing to a monthly section of why I'd retrospectives, new hires, discretionary bonuses, work, and a verse where he's big feature releases. I mean, anything that we want to announce and celebrate, we ought to make sure that it's going to want to say shout to the rooftops, but we're shout to the heavens, but they're big deals. And we don't make in and we undersell. Yeah. Oh, sorry. And hey, Fernando here. So I'm shadowing Wayne now just to introduce myself from the technical marketing team. And I'll send the document right now, which is something that we do for our kind of get together team meetings. And it kind of shows, you can look through it. I shared it to everyone on the Zoom chat, but you can see that we provide updates, the new team members, and small little introductions. And you can see sections that we have on gratitude and actual spotlights that we show like who we're actually praising what they've done that's good and how we can highlight that because that will motivate employees kind of really increase that morale because what we're seeing is these employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done and they're getting shout outs because a lot of times, at least in our team, the cases, we don't really, although we work with each other, where we sometimes are kind of siloed busy working on different things. So it's good to know what everyone's working on and what everyone's doing. So somewhat related to to what you were just speaking on, but just that I'd share that. Thanks, Fernando. Going D. So I'm not going to read all this from Daniel Croft, but summarizing he is looking for feedback on the development vision, admission and direction. We're brainstorming on in the development department, on mission and vision in particular, the approach is going, everybody, you open up a little spreadsheet and follow the instructions. Anybody interested? So if you're interested in doing so, should take about 10 to 15 minutes, please do it in the next week. Good stuff there. So we covered also the development off site Daniel, so it's an action item to follow up on. Thomas, you've got E. Yep, because I cannot remember. And so I'm hoping to crowdsource a little bit of configuration or archaeology, so to speak. Is there a reason that we don't use reviewer re-let? If folks can remember, the reason I'm asking is is contained within that thread, but that is a tool that actually is being used to track if we have enough maintainers and any given project, and since we don't use it, we're showing up. And so that's why I was, that's why I'm asking. When you say reviewer, are you talking about on the individual analyzers? Yeah. Speaking of only for DAS, we haven't had a need for it, because we have six engineers, but just going to rule that the same six people. Yeah, rule of six that I did. That's what I kind of think it is, but it's from a larger, if the company, where do we need more maintainers as the question that the organization is asking? I mean, I'd suggest they're looking in the wrong place if they're looking in real late, to see, to find out the number of maintainers that's the wrong place, the engineering projects page should list all the maintainers. If you set up your team, you're more in-treet correctly. I would have thought that was smaller, single social trade. Apparently not. Yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at the chart. I mean, I think on some of these projects, we just haven't told it out. All of you, like we have the API, we have one engineer that works on it. So we haven't gone in the maintainer there, because they know who they are. So if we are trying to maintain that as a single social trick, we need to just go through and scrub it. Sorry, Seth, then reminded of this. I'm reminded of this Spider-Man meme with the two Spider-Man pointing at each other. Who's the real viewer? Who's the author? It's the same person. It's been a long day, so a little punchy. But yes, that makes sense. So Seth, you have not added up to individual team members, YAML FAUX, and the Handbook. Right, I believe for that one, there's just no injury for it. I mean, we could. I think if you didn't do it, I think that should do it. Yeah, well, it should. They shouldn't be using just remotely. They should be using that as a source of code. So I think if you've listed my entire, that should cover it. I follow up, question would be, does that cover the senior plus, the engineer must be a maintainer? Requirement or not? How much you buried the lead? What do you call buried the lead? I took the read only off your comment there. So you can post it. Well, we're going to end with the best things of the day. That's all. That's not. But, um, is, but the maintainer requirement? Yes, it does. Oh, maybe because it's required for senior plus. Going back to that is just maintaining one or more. I think it's a requirement for an approval. So I was talking about the Olivia and is. Yeah, I know. I was just making sure we were finished with the topic above. All right. And we're at time. So I will move on to take that as a prop. Yeah, Olivia has a pop back on Slack to announce that the newest edition of their family is here and happened over the weekend. So I so they can grasp this family for that and we'll be hoping to celebrate him later when he does when he returns to work. Oh, thanks everybody. Have a great day.
